This was done by proposing and validating a unified model of electronic voting system adoption (UMEVSA) based on UTAUT. The results show that while performance expectancy was significant in determining the intention to adopt an e-voting system, effort expectancy does not. However, effort expectancy was found to be a positive determinant of the performance expectancy of an electronic voting system. Also, citizen trust in institutions positively predicts both the performance and effort expectancy of an electronic voting system and the intention to use an electronic voting system. The implications of these findings are discussed.",

Previously proposed e-voting systems make use of a central database to store data, resulting in the servers used to store these databases being a single point of failure. These systems have also been found to be vulnerable to DoS attacks, leading to concerns over their reliability.Blockchains have been used to build secure and scalable distributed systems which have shown several benefits over centralized systems. They have seen uses in sectors ranging from finance and healthcare to food and energy.In this paper, we present VoteChain, a blockchain based voting system to help bring transparency and security to polls. We report on our implementation of VoteChain, as well as the results obtained in testing the system in a real-world poll which prove that such a system can be used in practice for large-scale elections.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of the electronic voting (e-voting) system has received much attention by researchers in recent years. E-voting has been of interest to stakeholders and political party leaders in most countries (that is developed and developing) practicing democracy. Academics and technocrats have delved into technical issues related to e-voting system that could foster its smooth implementation and this have encouraged it’s full acceptance in many countries. The challenge however, is how to secure and maintain a trustworthy e-voting system devoid of security breaches especially from hacking and hijacking. The challenge still remains an open area that calls for novel designs into high level security infrastructure that may enhance and improve the security of e-voting systems to gain the full trust, acceptance, and adoption by the citizenry. Ghana deploys computerized system for registration and verification during the electoral process. During the 2016 election, the Electoral Commission of Ghana adopted the electronic transmission of results although the elections were conducted manually. In this paper, a novel secured framework for electronic voting relying on the principle of the Information Dispersal Algorithm (IDA) is proposed. In our approach, upon voting, the voters vote record is encrypted and split for distribution on several virtual cloud servers. At the end of the voting period, the split vote records are reassembled into their original state for counting to take place. The splitting of the vote records and its assembling are performed by the IDA. The paper further discusses the design and implementation of the IDA in a typical e-voting environment.",

    "abstract": "Election voting has emerged as a significant alternative to conventional voting methods with testimonials of its implementation showing various degrees of success in some countries of the western world. Lately, many developing countries are also looking at its prospects as a replacement or supplement for traditional paper balloting which is, the principal voting method in most of these countries. However, the voting populace’ acceptance of this technology is a major factor that needs to be considered before its actual introduction owning to factors that includes, digital divides, low literacy level, norms and beliefs, high poverty level and so on. From another viewpoint, due to the peculiarity of contextual ICT infrastructural challenges of developing countries, there is a need to investigate the factors that will influence adoption decision and eventual usage when planning to introduce electronic voting so that the evolving system will not end up being impractical for the target users. In this study, an empirical investigation of the factors influencing the adoption decision of electronic voting was carried out.  More specifically, this study aimed at examining the possibilities and intents towards mobile voting (which is a type of electronic voting), among a selected sample population of electorates in Nigeria. In the study, an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) that integrates Subjective norm, Perceived compatibility, Perceived privacy, Perceived security, Perceived price value and Perceived trust into the original TAM constructs was proposed. A total of 1364 sample data were collected from a selected population of electorates who had at one time or the other participated in at least an electioneering process in Nigeria.  The data was then analyzed statistically using Partial Least Square           Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results obtained show that all variables have significant effect on the electorates’ behavioural intention to use mobile voting except for perceived privacy.",

    "abstract": "This article aims to examine the legal and policy challenges associated with adopting an electronic voting (e-voting) system in Nigeria’s electoral process. Nigeria, Africa’s largest democracy, has for many years been held down by issues of election fraud, thuggery, violence as seen in past manual elections in the country. The article argues that, if properly implemented and financed, e-election offers great promise and potential as the panacea for voter fraud in Nigeria’s electoral system. First, it examines the theoretical, legal and constitutional basis for e-voting. Second, drawing lessons from other jurisdictions, it analyses practical challenges for the implementation and adoption of an e-voting system in Nigeria. These challenges include the possible compromise of e-voting devices, by viruses or other malicious software; manipulation by people with privileged access to the system, either system developers, system administrators or malicious hackers; denial-of-service attacks (attacks that result in the e-voting facility being disabled or otherwise unavailable for voters to use); lack of adequate supervision mechanisms; and the difficulties of proving electronic attacks in courts of law among other things. Many of these problems are beyond the contemplation of and, therefore, are unaddressed by Nigeria’s Electoral Act, making the law currently incapable and unsuitable to effectively respond to these problems. The article calls for a reform of the Nigerian Electoral Act to better address peculiar legal and constitutional challenges associated with e-voting systems.

    "abstract": "Information technology has pervaded virtually every facet of human life. Even in the delivery of governance, information technology has gradually found a place. One of its applications is the use of electronic voting, also known as e-voting, as opposed to the traditional manual method of voting. This form of voting, however, is not immune to challenges generally associated with voting. Two of these include guaranteeing voting access to all eligible voters, and providing necessary voting security. The challenge of accessibility is especially peculiar to developing countries where IT adoption is still relatively low. This paper proposes a framework for an e-voting system that would most benefit developing economies. It ensures availability of the system to only eligible voters and integrity of the voting process through its capacity to identify and prevent ineligible voters and multiple voting. To guarantee accessibility to all eligible voters, it supports both online and offline voting capabilities. Adopting electronic form of voting would provide a more robust, easier to use, and reliable system of voting, which, consequently, would contribute towards enhancing the delivery of democratic dividends.",

    "abstract": "Electronic voting (e-voting) presents a convenient and cost-effective alternative to current paper ballot-based voting. It provides many benefits such as increased voter turnout and accuracy in the decision-making process. While presenting many improvements, e-voting still faces serious security challenges that hinder its adoption. In this paper, we propose a novel remote e-voting scheme that can enhance the integrity, efficiency, and voter turnout of the election process. Our proposed work is secure and preserves the privacy of voters through secure multi-party computations performed by parties of differing allegiances. It also leverages a blockchain running smart contracts as a publicly accessible and tamper-resistant bulletin board to permanently store votes and prevent double-voting. In our security and privacy analysis, we show that our proposed scheme is secure against potential threats and provides voter anonymity. Our performance discussion shows that the proposed scheme is practical for large-scale elections. Index Terms—Remote e-voting, blockchain, smart contract.",

The study began with a demonstration against this policy conducted by a number of village heads in Sleman Regency. The e-voting system in the pilkades is not a new thing in the history of democracy in Indonesia. Some districts such as Jembrana, Boyolali, Pemalang, Musi Rawas and other regions have implemente this new pattern of elections without any significant problems especially in the form of resistance form the communit. \nThis study uses a qualitative descriptive method, by describing what is expressed by the informant of a phenomenon that occurs in the midst of the community in addressing such technology adoption (e-voting). Based on the results of this study found two categories of reasons for resistantion, namely : objective reasons and subjective reasons, including: (1) Objective Reasons: Not Easy, Economic Threats, Damaging Regulatory Values, and Fear of Loss of Status and POwer. (2) Subjective Reasons: Fear of Failure, Damaging Cultural Values, and Low Trust. \nThose reasons are in harmony with the nine causes of resistance to change as stated by Gary A. Yukl in his book entitled “Leadership in Organization” (2010). he nine reasons for the emergence of resistance are mady by the author as a theoritical basis in studying the resistance factor of the e-voting election policy. \n  \nKeywords : resistance, e-voting, pilkades, change, policy",

On the other hand, recent publication has been informed several issues occurred such as technicality, reliability, security and privacy due to the compromised system were used. In small scale, there are certain group of people who want to exploit the vulnerabilities for their own benefit in the election, while in the greater scale, it can reduce public confidence to entrust the adoption of e-voting system to augment participation rate, to improve the quality of voting and to aid the political right effectively. This paper aims to investigate the characteristic of people demanding the legislative to address the criteria and indicator for effective implementation in electronic voting. By understanding the perception of voters in viewing current electoral regulation are essential to provide some ideas and opinions for better enhancement, either through recommendation and drafting related legislation to cater the needs.",

    "abstract": "Electronic voting or e-voting has been used in varying forms since 1970s with fundamental benefits over paper-based systems such as increased efficiency and reduced errors. However, challenges remain to the achieving of wide spread adoption of such systems, especially with respect to improving their resilience against potential faults. Blockchain is a disruptive technology of the current era and promises to improve the overall resilience of e-voting systems. This article presents an effort to leverage benefits of blockchain such as cryptographic foundations and transparency to achieve an effective scheme for e-voting. The proposed scheme conforms to the fundamental requirements for e-voting schemes and achieves end-to-end verifiability. The article presents details of the proposed e-voting scheme along with its implementation using Multichain platform. The article also presents an in-depth evaluation of the scheme which successfully demonstrates its effectiveness to achieve an end-to-end verifiable e-voting scheme.",

    "abstract": ": The aspect of electoral fraud and lack of transparency in the conventional voting system employed in India is a major problem that requires attention. The objective is to implement a secure e-voting system based on blockchain technology that counteracts the above-mentioned issues. The aim is to fight electoral malpractices by developing a system which will keep data secure in digital voting and prevent tampering of data while introducing a level of transparency in the system. One might argue that online voting is susceptible to database manipulation, however the adoption of blockchain technology solves this by its inherent property of decentralization wherein data is not stored in a central database, rather distributed over a vast network of peered systems. Electoral fraud in the form of voter impersonation and voting multiple times can be solved by the use of biometric voter authentication which has been implemented in the prototype of an Electronic Voting Machine (EVM). This paper discusses the design and implementation of the system proposed.",

    "abstract": "Internet voting is an emerging e-government phenomenon. In the United States, several state and local governments have experimented with Internet voting. This study presents a model of Internet voting adoption that integrates diffusion of innovation theory, institution-based trust and e-government utilization. To test the model a survey is administered to 372 citizens. The results of structural equation modeling indicate that relative advantage, Internet trust, and e-government information utilization have a significant impact on intention to use Internet voting. In addition to these direct effects, disposition to trust has a significant impact on Internet trust and accessibility has a significant impact on relative advantage. Not only are citizens interested in using the Internet to obtain government information, but also to cast their ballot. As a result, opportunities for Internet use in the political process are constantly emerging. Government agencies should take advantage of technological innovations to improve the accessibility of the electronic ballot, to communicate the advantages of this phenomenon and to engender trust among the citizenry.",

Therefore, some people due to economics, politics or social reasons expect the e-voting use will facilitate and solve previous election’s problem. Unfortunately, the most complex and difficult practical implementation with distinct problems depends on the particular condition or culture. One of essential factor concerning the adoption related to privacy protection. Thus, this study examines the relationship of perceived benefit and privacy concern towards personal data protection by establishing model of formative measurement. For the generalization purposes, a survey questionnaire consists of 4 categories of 45 items was distributed offline and online to approximately 800 people with purposive sampling in selected multicultural cities in Indonesia. The result suggested that the Perceived Benefit (PBen) has the strongest predictive value of ƒ2 and Q2 compare to Privacy Concern (PCon) with 0.212 and 0.083 respectively.",

Electronic voting systems (e-voting) must be taken seriously and ensure transparency, certainty, security, accountability, and accuracy. In addition to technology readiness, of course, it must be supported by the readiness of the community in implementing this e-voting system in the future. The government's unpreparedness and lack of socialization of e-voting can also be a factor triggering failure in implementing this system.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: General elections as a means of democracy pillar have been used in most countries in the world, including Indonesia. Along with current technological developments, voting can be done electronically, which is known as electronic voting (E-Voting). The application of E-Voting is expected to be able to overcome the problems that occur when using conventional systems, such as process effectiveness, the accuracy of the result, implementation costs and community satisfaction. One of the problems that remain to be resolved with this system is related to data security and its results. Many methods can be used to support security systems, one of which is the QR Code. This research tries to develop a security system using the QR Code. An E-Voting system with QR Code-based security has been designed and tested. Based on the results, the system has an accuracy rate of 93%, an average detection rate of 4 seconds, and 7% undetectable data with an average speed of 8 seconds. In general, it can be said that the system can run well with the expected performance. ABSTRAK: Pemilihan umum sebagai sarana demokrasi telah digunakan di sebagian besar negara di dunia termasuk Indonesia. Seiring dengan perkembangan teknologi saat ini, voting dapat dilakukan secara elektronik, yang disebut dengan elektronik voting (E-Voting). Penerapan E-Voting diharapkan mampu mengatasi permasalahan yang terjadi saat menggunakan sistem konvensional, seperti efektifitas proses, tingkat akurasi, biaya pelaksanaan dan kepuasan masyarakat. Salah satu problem yang masih harus diselesaikan pada sistem ini adalah terkait pengamanan data dan hasilnya. Banyak metode yang dapat digunakan untuk mendukung sistem keamanan, salah satunya QR Code. Penelitian ini mencoba mengembangkan sistem pengamanan menggunakan QR Code. Sebuah sistem E-Voting dengan pengamanan berbasis QR Code telah dirancang dan diuji coba. Dari hasi uji coba didapat sistem memiliki tingkat akurasi sebesar 93%, tingkat deteksi rata-rata kecepatan 4 detik, serta 7% data tidak terdeteksi dengan rata-rata kecepatan 8 detik. Secara umum dapat dikatakan bahwa sistem hasil perancangan dapat berjalan dengan baik dengan performa sesuai yang diharapkan.",

    "abstract": "The increasing of digital technology today has helped many people to fulfill their needs. But the election system, still conventionally using paper in its implementation. Elections in general still use a centralized system, where there is an organization that manages it. Some of the problems that may occur in traditional electoral systems are that there are organizations that have full control over the database and system, so the possibility of hacking the database is quite a big opportunity. Blockchain innovation is one arrangement that can be utilized in light of the fact that it has a decentralized framework and the whole database is duplicated by all clients. Blockchain itself has been used by Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrency which is known as a decentralized system. By using the blockchain in database recording on an e-voting system can reduce one source of fraud that is database manipulation. This study discusses the recording of voting data using blockchain technology. The implementation of Smart Contracts contained in the Ethereum Blockchain will be implemented to create this voting system",

However, trust as a construct has generally been studied without clear specifications of its underlying dimensions. As part of building a more comprehensive understanding of trust in e-voting, we propose and validate the underlying dimensions of trust in technology to be security, usability, privacy and validity. In an application to e-voting, we propose that greater trust in its technology could mitigate its perceived risks, and lead to higher intentions to use e-voting. To test our model, we collected data from 426 voters in East Java province, Indonesia. The findings confirmed the validity of all proposed dimensions of trust of technology. Trust of technology is a significant determinant of intention to use e-voting. Trust of technology also indirectly influences intentions to use e-voting through perceived risks.",

    "abstract": "A blockchain is a distributed, digitized and consensus-based secure information storage mechanism. The present article provides an overview of blockchain based e-voting systems. The primary purpose of this review is to study the up-to-date state of blockchain-based voting research along with associated possible challenges while aiming to forecast future directions. The methodology applied in the review is a systematic review approach. Following an introduction to the basic structure and features of the blockchain in relation to e-voting, we provide a conceptual description of the desired blockchain-based e-voting application. Symmetrical and asymmetrical cryptography improvements play a key role in developing blockchain systems. We have extracted and reviewed 63 research papers from scientific databases that have advised the adoption of the blockchain framework to voting systems. These articles indicate that blockchain-supported voting systems may provide different solutions than traditional e-voting. We classified the main prevailing issues into the five following categories: general, integrity, coin-based, privacy and consensus. As a result of this research, it was determined that blockchain systems can provide solutions to certain problems that prevail in current election systems. On the other hand, privacy protection and transaction speed are most frequently emphasized problems in blockchain applications. Security of remote participation and scalability should be improved for sustainable blockchain based e-voting. It was concluded that frameworks needed enhancements in order to be used in voting systems due to these reservations.",

    "abstract": "The ever growing number of Ghanaians living abroad and their contribution to the nation’s GDP has propelled the political debate of their voting rights. After formulating policies to enable them to exercise their franchise during elections, E-Voting/Internet Voting was one of the methods proposed to be used by diaspora Ghanaians to effectively exercise their right to vote. Thisresearch investigates and identifies the main determinants of E-Voting Adoption by eligible voters living ab road. A sample of 71 respondents from Malaysia, Singapore and USA has been used to collect the data. Regression and correlation analysis was conducted using SPSS 20. Regression beta coefficient and correlation coefficients were generated to test the hypotheses and to ascertain the effect of Information &amp; Communication Technology, Political and Socio-demographical factors on adopting E-Voting System. The result shows strong linear relationship between some of the factors and E-Voting Adoption.<br>",
