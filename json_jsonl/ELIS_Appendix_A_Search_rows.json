    "abstract": "Indian Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) will be fitted with printers that\nproduce Voter-Verifiable Paper Audit Trails (VVPATs) in time for the 2019\ngeneral election. VVPATs provide evidence that each vote was recorded as the\nvoter intended, without having to trust the perfection or security of the EVMs.\n  However, confidence in election results requires more: VVPATs must be\npreserved inviolate and then actually used to check the reported election\nresult in a trustworthy way that the public can verify. A full manual tally\nfrom the VVPATs could be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming; moreover,\nit is difficult for the public to determine whether a full hand count was\nconducted accurately. We show how Risk-Limiting Audits (RLAs) could provide\nhigh confidence in Indian election results. Compared to full hand recounts,\nRLAs typically require manually inspecting far fewer VVPATs when the outcome is\ncorrect, and are much easier for the electorate to observe in adequate detail\nto determine whether the result is trustworthy.",

However,\neach of these proposals comes with a different and often not well-articulated\ncorruption model, has different objectives, and is accompanied by security\nclaims which are never formalized and are at best justified only against\nspecific attacks.

To ensure integrity of\nelectoral rolls, the current practice is to either make electoral rolls public\nor share them with the political parties. However, this enables construction of\ndetailed voter profiles and selective targeting and manipulation of voters,\nthereby undermining the fundamental principle of free and fair elections. In\nthis paper, we study the problem of designing publicly auditable yet\nprivacy-preserving electoral rolls. We first formulate a threat model and\nprovide formal security definitions. We then present a protocol for creation,\nmaintenance and usage of electoral rolls that mitigates the threats. Eligible\nvoters can verify their inclusion, whereas political parties and auditors can\nstatistically audit the electoral roll. Further, the audit can also detect\npolling-day ballot stuffing and denials to eligible voters by malicious polling\nofficers. The entire electoral roll is never revealed, which prevents any\nlarge-scale systematic voter targeting and manipulation.",

    "abstract": "E-voting systems have emerged as a powerful technology for improving\ndemocracy by reducing election cost, increasing voter participation, and even\nallowing voters to directly verify the entire election procedure. Prior\ninternet voting systems have single points of failure, which may result in the\ncompromise of availability, voter secrecy, or integrity of the election\nresults. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, security\nanalysis, and evaluation of D-DEMOS, a complete e-voting system that is\ndistributed, privacy-preserving and end-to-end verifiable. Our system includes\na fully asynchronous vote collection subsystem that provides immediate\nassurance to the voter her vote was recorded as cast, without requiring\ncryptographic operations on behalf of the voter. We also include a distributed,\nreplicated and fault-tolerant Bulletin Board component, that stores all\nnecessary election-related information, and allows any party to read and verify\nthe complete election process. Finally, we also incorporate trustees, i.e.,\nindividuals who control election result production while guaranteeing privacy\nand end-to-end-verifiability as long as their strong majority is honest. Our\nsystem is the first e-voting system whose voting operation is human verifiable,\ni.e., a voter can vote over the web, even when her web client stack is\npotentially unsafe, without sacrificing her privacy, and still be assured her\nvote was recorded as cast. Additionally, a voter can outsource election\nauditing to third parties, still without sacrificing privacy. Finally, as the\nnumber of auditors increases, the probability of election fraud going\nundetected is diminished exponentially. We provide a model and security\nanalysis of the system. We implement a prototype of the complete system, we\nmeasure its performance experimentally, and we demonstrate its ability to\nhandle large-scale elections.",

    "abstract": "Digital societies increasingly rely on trustworthy proofs of physical\npresence for services such as supply-chain tracking, e-voting, ride-sharing,\nand location-based rewards. Yet, traditional localization methods often lack\ncryptographic guarantees of where and when an entity was present, leaving them\nvulnerable to spoofing, replay, or collusion attacks. In response, research on\nProof-of-Location (PoL) has emerged, with recent approaches combining distance\nbounding, distributed consensus, and privacy-enhancing techniques to enable\nverifiable, tamper-resistant location claims.\n  As the design space for PoL systems grows in complexity, this paper provides\na unified framework to help practitioners navigate diverse application needs.\nWe first propose a taxonomy identifying four core domains: (1) cryptographic\nguarantees, (2) spatio-temporal synchronization, (3) trust and witness models,\nand (4) interaction and overhead. Building on this, we introduce a methodology\nto map application-specific requirements onto appropriate PoL architectures. We\nillustrate this process through three use cases (retail e-coupons, supply chain\nauditing, and physical e-voting), each showing how different constraints shape\nprotocol choices. Overall, this work offers a structured approach to building\nsecure, scalable, and interoperable PoL systems.",

    "abstract": "E-voting systems are a powerful technology for improving democracy.\nUnfortunately, prior voting systems have single points-of-failure, which may\ncompromise availability, privacy, or integrity of the election results.\n  We present the design, implementation, security analysis, and evaluation of\nthe D-DEMOS suite of distributed, privacy-preserving, and end-to-end verifiable\ne-voting systems. We present two systems: one asynchronous and one with minimal\ntiming assumptions but better performance. Our systems include a distributed\nvote collection subsystem that does not require cryptographic operations on\nbehalf of the voter. We also include a distributed, replicated and\nfault-tolerant Bulletin Board component, that stores all necessary\nelection-related information, and allows any party to read and verify the\ncomplete election process. Finally, we incorporate trustees, who control result\nproduction while guaranteeing privacy and end-to-end-verifiability as long as\ntheir strong majority is honest.\n  Our suite of e-voting systems are the first whose voting operation is human\nverifiable, i.e., a voter can vote over the web, even when her web client stack\nis potentially unsafe, without sacrificing her privacy, and still be assured\nher vote was recorded as cast. Additionally, a voter can outsource election\nauditing to third parties, still without sacrificing privacy.\n  We provide a model and security analysis of the systems, implement complete\nprototypes, measure their performance experimentally, and demonstrate their\nability to handle large-scale elections. Finally, we demonstrate the\nperformance trade-offs between the two versions of the system. A preliminary\nversion of our system was used to conduct exit-polls at three voting sites for\ntwo national-level elections and is being adopted for use by the largest civil\nunion of workers in Greece, consisting of over a half million members.",

    "abstract": "In traditional e-voting protocols, privacy is often provided by a trusted\nauthority that learns the votes and computes the tally. Some protocols replace\nthe trusted authority by a set of authorities, and privacy is guaranteed if\nless than a threshold number of authorities are corrupt. For verifiability,\nstronger security guarantees are demanded. Typically, corrupt authorities that\ntry to fake the result of the tally must always be detected.\n  To provide verifiability, many e-voting protocols use Non-Interactive\nZero-Knowledge proofs (NIZKs). Thanks to their non-interactive nature, NIZKs\nallow anybody, including third parties that do not participate in the protocol,\nto verify the correctness of the tally. Therefore, NIZKs can be used to obtain\nuniversal verifiability. Additionally, NIZKs also improve usability because\nthey allow voters to cast a vote using a non-interactive protocol.\n  The disadvantage of NIZKs is that their security is based on setup\nassumptions such as the common reference string (CRS) or the random oracle (RO)\nmodel. The former requires a trusted party for the generation of a common\nreference string. The latter, though a popular methodology for designing secure\nprotocols, has been shown to be unsound.\n  In this paper, we address the design of an e-voting protocol that provides\nverifiability without any trust assumptions, where verifiability here is meant\nwithout eligibility verification. We show that Non-Interactive\nWitness-Indistinguishable proofs (NIWI) can be used for this purpose. The\ne-voting scheme is private under the Decision Linear assumption, while\nverifiability holds unconditionally. To our knowledge, this is the first\nprivate e-voting scheme with perfect universal verifiability, i.e. one in which\nthe probability of a fake tally not being detected is 0, and with {\\em\nnon-interactive} protocols that does not rely on trust assumptions.",

Promoters of this research project at DARPA, the\nagency that sponsored the research, should acknowledge that MERGE is internet\nvoting (election results rely on votes transmitted over the internet except in\nthe event of a full hand count) and refrain from claiming that it could be a\ncomponent of trustworthy elections without sweeping changes to election law and\nelection administration throughout the U.S.",

An efficient RLA requires checking relatively few ballots. Here we\nconstruct highly efficient RLAs by optimizing supermartingale tuning\nparameters--$\\textit{bets}$--for ballot-level comparison audits. The exactly\noptimal bets depend on the true rate of errors in cast-vote records\n(CVRs)--digital receipts detailing how machines tabulated each ballot. We\nevaluate theoretical and simulated workloads for audits of contests with a\nrange of diluted margins and CVR error rates. Compared to bets recommended in\npast work, using these optimal bets can dramatically reduce expected\nworkloads--by 93% on average over our simulated audits. Because the exactly\noptimal bets are unknown in practice, we offer some strategies for\napproximating them. As with the ballot-polling RLAs described in ALPHA and\nRiLACs, adapting bets to previously sampled data or diversifying them over a\nrange of suspected error rates can lead to substantially more efficient audits\nthan fixing bets to $\\textit{a priori}$ values, especially when those values\nare far from correct.

In principle AWAIRE can audit IRV\ncontests with any number of candidates, but the original implementation\nincurred memory and computation costs that grew superexponentially with the\nnumber of candidates. This paper improves the algorithmic implementation of\nAWAIRE in three ways that make it practical to audit IRV contests with 55\ncandidates, compared to the previous 6 candidates. First, rather than trying\nfrom the start to rule out all candidate elimination orders that produce a\ndifferent winner, the algorithm starts by considering only the final round,\ntesting statistically whether each candidate could have won that round. For\nthose candidates who cannot be ruled out at that stage, it expands to consider\nearlier and earlier rounds until either it provides strong evidence that the\nreported winner really won or a full hand count is conducted, revealing who\nreally won. Second, it tests a richer collection of conditions, some of which\ncan rule out many elimination orders at once. Third, it exploits relationships\namong those conditions, allowing it to abandon testing those that are unlikely\nto help. We provide real-world examples with up to 36 candidates and synthetic\nexamples with up to 55 candidates, showing how audit sample size depends on the\nmargins and on the tuning parameters.

    "abstract": "Online voting is convenient and flexible, but amplifies the risks of voter\ncoercion and vote buying. One promising mitigation strategy enables voters to\ngive a coercer fake voting credentials, which silently cast votes that do not\ncount. Current systems along these lines make problematic assumptions about\ncredential issuance, however, such as strong trust in a registrar and/or in\nvoter-controlled hardware, or expecting voters to interact with multiple\nregistrars. Votegral is the first coercion-resistant voting architecture that\nleverages the physical security of in-person registration to address these\ncredential-issuance challenges, amortizing the convenience costs of in-person\nregistration by reusing credentials across successive elections. Votegral's\nregistration component, TRIP, gives voters a kiosk in a privacy booth with\nwhich to print real and fake credentials on paper, eliminating dependence on\ntrusted hardware in credential issuance. The voter learns and can verify in the\nprivacy booth which credential is real, but real and fake credentials\nthereafter appear indistinguishable to others. Only voters actually under\ncoercion, a hopefully-rare case, need to trust the kiosk. To achieve\nverifiability, each paper credential encodes an interactive zero-knowledge\nproof, which is sound in real credentials but unsound in fake credentials.\nVoters observe the difference in the order of printing steps, but need not\nunderstand the technical details. Experimental results with our prototype\nsuggest that Votegral is practical and sufficiently scalable for real-world\nelections. User-visible latency of credential issuance in TRIP is at most 19.7\nseconds even on resource-constrained kiosk hardware. A companion usability\nstudy indicates that TRIP's usability is competitive with other e-voting\nsystems, and formal proofs support TRIP's combination of coercion-resistance\nand verifiability.",

    "abstract": "Programmable blockchains have long been a hot research topic given their\ntremendous use in decentralized applications. Smart contracts, using\nblockchains as their underlying technology, inherit the desired properties such\nas verifiability, immutability, and transparency, which make it a great suit in\ntrustless environments.\n  In this thesis, we consider several decentralized protocols to be built on\nblockchains, specifically using smart contracts on Ethereum. We used\nalgorithmic and cryptographic tools in our implementations to further improve\nthe level of security and efficiency beyond the state-of-the-art works. We\nproposed a new approach called Blind Vote, which is an untraceable, secure,\nefficient, secrecy-preserving, and fully on-chain electronic voting protocol\nbased on the well-known concept of Chaum's blind signatures. We illustrate that\nour approach achieves the same security guarantees as previous methods such as\nTornado Vote [1], while consuming significantly less gas. Thus, we provide a\ncheaper and considerably more gas-efficient alternative for anonymous\nblockchain-based voting. On the other hand, we propose a new family of\nalgorithms for private, trustless auctions that protect bidder identities and\nbid values while remaining practical for smart contract execution. We ensure\ntrustlessness by running the auction logic in a smart contract, thereby\neliminating reliance on any single trusted party. This approach prevents bid\ntampering, front-running, and collusion by enforcing immutability and\ndecentralized verification of bids. The resulting protocol uniquely combines\nefficiency, trustlessness, and enduring bid privacy, offering a scalable and\nsecure solution for blockchain-based marketplaces and other decentralized\napplications.",

As a result, in the presence of\njust a few outliers, it often fails to reflect the varying accuracy as the\ninlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. In this work, we\npropose an alternative error metric for evaluating the accuracy of the\nreconstructed camera trajectory. Our metric, named Discernible Trajectory Error\n(DTE), is computed in five steps: (1) Shift the ground-truth and estimated\ntrajectories such that both of their geometric medians are located at the\norigin. (2) Rotate the estimated trajectory such that it minimizes the sum of\ngeodesic distances between the corresponding camera orientations. (3) Scale the\nestimated trajectory such that the median distance of the cameras to their\ngeometric median is the same as that of the ground truth. (4) Compute,\nwinsorize and normalize the distances between the corresponding cameras. (5)\nObtain the DTE by taking the average of the mean and the root-mean-square (RMS)\nof the resulting distances. This metric is an attractive alternative to the\nATE, in that it is capable of discerning the varying trajectory accuracy as the\ninlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. Using the similar\nidea, we also propose a novel rotation error metric, named Discernible Rotation\nError (DRE), which has similar advantages to the DTE. Furthermore, we propose a\nsimple yet effective method for calibrating the camera-to-marker rotation,\nwhich is needed for the computation of our metrics.

However, in scenarios\ninvolving sensitive interactions -- such as e-voting or e-cash -- there is a\ngrowing need for more controlled signing mechanisms. Strong-Designated Verifier\nSignature (SDVS) offers such control by allowing the signer to specify and\nrestrict the verifier of a signature. The existing state-of-the-art SDVS are\nmostly based on number-theoretic hardness assumptions. Thus, they are not\nsecure against quantum attacks. Moreover, Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)-based\nSDVS are inefficient and have large key and signature sizes. In this work, we\naddress these challenges and propose an efficient post-quantum SDVS (namely,\nLaSDVS) based on ideal lattices under the hardness assumptions of the Ring-SIS\nand Ring-LWE problems. LaSDVS achieves advanced security properties including\nstrong unforgeability under chosen-message attacks, non-transferability,\nnon-delegatability, and signer anonymity.

    "abstract": "Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) are rigorous statistical procedures meant to\ndetect invalid election results. RLAs examine paper ballots cast during the\nelection to statistically assess the possibility of a disagreement between the\nwinner determined by the ballots and the winner reported by tabulation. The\nmost ballot efficient approaches proceed by \"ballot comparison.\" However,\nballot comparison requires an untrusted declaration of the contents of each\ncast ballot, rather than a simple tabulation of vote totals. This \"cast-vote\nrecord table\" (CVR) is then spot-checked against ballots for consistency. In\nmany practical settings, the cost of generating a suitable CVR dominates the\ncost of conducting the audit, preventing widespread adoption of these\nsample-efficient techniques.\n  We introduce a new RLA procedure: an \"adaptive ballot comparison\" audit. In\nthis audit, a global CVR is never produced; instead, a three-stage procedure is\niterated:\n  1) a batch is selected,\n  2) a CVR is produced for that batch, and\n  3) a ballot within the batch is sampled, inspected by auditors, and compared\nwith the CVR.\n  We prove that such an audit can achieve risk commensurate with standard\ncomparison audits while generating a fraction of the CVR. We present three main\ncontributions:\n  1) a formal adversarial model for RLAs;\n  2) definition and analysis of an adaptive audit procedure with rigorous risk\nlimits and an associated correctness analysis accounting for the incidental\nerrors arising in typical audits; and\n  3) an analysis of practical efficiency.\n  This method can be organized in rounds (as is typical for comparison audits)\nwhere sampled CVRs are produced in parallel. Using data from Florida's 2020\npresidential election with 5% risk and 1% margin, only 22% of the CVR is\ngenerated; at 10% margin, only 2% is generated.",

    "abstract": "Internet voting will probably be one of the most significant achievements of\nthe future information society. It will have an enormous impact on the election\nprocess making it fast, reliable and inexpensive. Nonetheless, so far remote\nvoting is considered to be very difficult, as one has to take into account\nsusceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most\nthe research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site\nelectronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they\ncannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform\nproblem. However, the cryptographic components they utilize may be very useful.\nThis paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic\nencryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques\nrecommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol\ntries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible\nfor manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper\nballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations\n(lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes,\nis performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme\nis characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the\nserver side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the\nvoter's side, and offers distributed trust, receipt-freeness and verifiability.",

    "abstract": "Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) offer a statistical guarantee: if a full manual\ntally of the paper ballots would show that the reported election outcome is\nwrong, an RLA has a known minimum chance of leading to a full manual tally.\nRLAs generally rely on random samples. Stratified sampling--partitioning the\npopulation of ballots into disjoint strata and sampling independently from the\nstrata--may simplify logistics or increase efficiency compared to simpler\nsampling designs, but makes risk calculations harder. We present SUITE, a new\nmethod for conducting RLAs using stratified samples. SUITE considers all\npossible partitions of outcome-changing error across strata. For each\npartition, it combines P-values from stratum-level tests into a combined\nP-value; there is no restriction on the tests used in different strata. SUITE\nmaximizes the combined P-value over all partitions of outcome-changing error.\nThe audit can stop if that maximum is less than the risk limit. Voting systems\nin some Colorado counties (comprising 98.2% of voters) allow auditors to check\nhow the system interpreted each ballot, which allows ballot-level comparison\nRLAs. Other counties use ballot polling, which is less efficient. Extant\napproaches to conducting an RLA of a statewide contest would require major\nchanges to Colorado's procedures and software, or would sacrifice the\nefficiency of ballot-level comparison. SUITE does not. It divides ballots into\ntwo strata: those cast in counties that can conduct ballot-level comparisons,\nand the rest. Stratum-level P-values are found by methods derived here. The\nresulting audit is substantially more efficient than statewide ballot polling.\nSUITE is useful in any state with a mix of voting systems or that uses\nstratified sampling for other reasons.

    "abstract": "Transparency and security are essential in our voting system, and voting\nmachines. This paper describes an implementation of a stateless, transparent\nvoting machine (STVM). The STVM is a ballot marking device (BMD) that uses a\ntransparent, interactive printing interface where voters can verify their paper\nballots as they fill out the ballot. The transparent interface turns the paper\nballot into an interactive interface. In this architecture, stateless describes\nthe machine's boot sequence, where no information is stored or passed forward\nbetween reboots. The machine does not have a hard drive. Instead, it boots and\nruns from read-only media. This STVM design utilizes a Blu-ray Disc ROM (BD-R)\nto boot the voting software. This system's statelessness and the transparent\ninteractive printing interface make this design the most secure BMD for voting.\nUnlike other voting methods, this system incorporates high usability,\naccessibility, and security for all voters. The STVM uses an open-source voting\nsystem that has a universally designed interface, making the system accessible\nfor all voters independent of their ability or disability. This system can make\nvoting safer by simultaneously addressing the issue of voters noticing a vote\nflip and making it difficult for a hack to persist or go unmitigated.",

    "abstract": "Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting\nincorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most\nefficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's\ninterpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,\nCVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same\ncards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in\na way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to\nrepresent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in\nwhich they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.\nBut for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote\nanonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast\nthem. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (\"cryptographic nonce\") on each\nballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.\nBut what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or\ndoes not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to\nconduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on\neach ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not\ncompromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method\nallows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.\nThe method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection\ndoes not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system\nmisbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results\nwhen the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and\nretrieval were accurate.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring ballot secrecy is critical for fair and trustworthy electronic\nvoting systems, yet achieving strong secrecy guarantees in decentralized,\nlarge-scale elections remains challenging. This paper proposes the concept of\ncollectively secure voting, in which voters themselves can opt in as secret\nholders to protect ballot secrecy. A practical blockchain-based collectively\nsecure voting system is designed and implemented. Our design strikes a balance\nbetween strong confidentiality guarantees and real-world applicability. The\nproposed system combines threshold cryptography and smart contracts to ensure\nballots remain confidential during voting, while all protocol steps remain\ntransparent and verifiable. Voters can use the system without prior blockchain\nknowledge through an intuitive user interface that hides underlying complexity.\nTo evaluate this approach, a user testing is conducted. Results show a high\nwillingness to act as secret holders, reliable participation in share release,\nand high security confidence in the proposed system. The findings demonstrate\nthat voters can collectively maintain secrecy and that such a practical\ndeployment is feasible.",

    "abstract": "Electronic voting systems have significant advantages in comparison with\nphysical voting systems. One of the main challenges in e-voting systems is to\nsecure the voting process: namely, to certify that the computed results are\nconsistent with the cast ballots and that the voters' privacy is preserved. We\npropose herein a secure voting protocol for elections that are governed by\norder-based voting rules. Our protocol, in which the tallying task is\ndistributed among several independent talliers, offers perfect ballot secrecy\nin the sense that it issues only the required output while no other information\non the cast ballots is revealed. Such perfect secrecy, achieved by employing\nsecure multiparty computation tools, may increase the voters' confidence and,\nconsequently, encourage them to vote according to their true preferences. We\nimplemented a demo of a voting system that is based on our protocol and we\ndescribe herein the system's components and its operation. Our implementation\ndemonstrates that our secure order-based voting protocol can be readily\nimplemented in real-life large-scale electronic elections.",

A dispute can be resolved if any third party can\nunambiguously determine who is right. We systematically characterize all\nrelevant disputes for a generic, practically relevant, class of voting\nprotocols. Based on our characterization, we propose a new definition of\ndispute resolution for voting that accounts for the possibility that both\nvoters and the voting authority can make false claims and that voters may\nabstain from voting.\n  A central aspect of our work is timeliness: a voter should possess the\nevidence required to resolve disputes no later than the election's end. We\ncharacterize what assumptions are necessary and sufficient for timeliness in\nterms of a communication topology for our voting protocol class. We formalize\nthe dispute resolution properties and communication topologies symbolically.\nThis provides the basis for verification of dispute resolution for a broad\nclass of protocols. To demonstrate the utility of our model, we analyze a\nmixnet-based voting protocol and prove that it satisfies dispute resolution as\nwell as verifiability and receipt-freeness.

Ballot stuffing is the\nattack where fake ballots (not cast by any eligible voter) are inserted into\nthe system. Participation privacy is about hiding which eligible voters have\nactually cast their vote. So far, the combination of ballot stuffing and\nparticipation privacy has been mostly studied for internet voting, where voters\nare assumed to own trusted computing devices. Such approaches are inapplicable\nto pollsite voting where voters typically vote bare handed. We present an\neligibility audit protocol to detect ballot stuffing in pollsite voting\nprotocols. This is done while protecting participation privacy from a remote\nobserver - one who does not physically observe voters during voting. Our\nprotocol can be instantiated as an additional layer on top of most existing\npollsite E2E-V voting protocols. To achieve our guarantees, we develop an\nefficient zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), that, given a value $v$ and a set $\\Phi$\nof commitments, proves $v$ is committed by some commitment in $\\Phi$, without\nrevealing which one. We call this a ZKP of reverse set membership because of\nits relationship to the popular ZKPs of set membership. This ZKP may be of\nindependent interest.",

We present BVOT, a self-tallying boardroom voting\nprotocol with ballot secrecy, fairness (no tally information is available\nbefore the polls close), and dispute-freeness (voters can observe that all\nvoters correctly followed the protocol).\n  BVOT works by using a multiparty threshold homomorphic encryption system in\nwhich each candidate is associated with a masked unique prime. Each voter\nengages in an oblivious transfer with an untrusted distributor: the voter\nselects the index of a prime associated with a candidate and receives the\nselected prime in masked form. The voter then casts their vote by encrypting\ntheir masked prime and broadcasting it to everyone. The distributor does not\nlearn the voter's choice, and no one learns the mapping between primes and\ncandidates until the audit phase. By hiding the mapping between primes and\ncandidates, BVOT provides voters with insufficient information to carry out\neffective cheating. The threshold feature prevents anyone from computing any\npartial tally---until everyone has voted. Multiplying all votes, their\ndecryption shares, and the unmasking factor yields a product of the primes each\nraised to the number of votes received.\n  In contrast to some existing boardroom voting protocols, BVOT does not rely\non any zero-knowledge proof; instead, it uses oblivious transfer to assure\nballot secrecy and correct vote casting. Also, BVOT can handle multiple\ncandidates in one election. BVOT prevents cheating by hiding crucial\ninformation: an attempt to increase the tally of one candidate might increase\nthe tally of another candidate.

    "abstract": "In a world where elections touch every aspect of society, the need for secure\nvoting is paramount. Traditional safeguards, based on classical cryptography,\nrely on complex math problems like factoring large numbers. However, quantum\ncomputing is changing the game. Recent advances in quantum technology suggest\nthat classical cryptographic methods may not be as secure as we thought. This\npaper introduces a quantum voting protocol, a blend of quantum principles\n(entanglement and superposition), blockchain technology, and digital\nsignatures, all powered by $\\log_2{n}$ qubits, and designed for approval voting\nwith n candidates. The result is a symphony of security features - binding,\nanonymity, non-reusability, verifiability, eligibility, and fairness - that\nchart a new course for voting security. The real world beckons, as we tested\nthis protocol on IBM quantum hardware, achieving impressively low error rates\nof just 1.17% in a four-candidate election.",

    "abstract": "Many voter-verifiable, coercion-resistant schemes have been proposed, but\neven the most carefully designed systems necessarily leak information via the\nannounced result. In corner cases, this may be problematic. For example, if all\nthe votes go to one candidate then all vote privacy evaporates. The mere\npossibility of candidates getting no or few votes could have implications for\nsecurity in practice: if a coercer demands that a voter cast a vote for such an\nunpopular candidate, then the voter may feel obliged to obey, even if she is\nconfident that the voting system satisfies the standard coercion resistance\ndefinitions. With complex ballots, there may also be a danger of \"Italian\"\nstyle (aka \"signature\") attacks: the coercer demands the voter cast a ballot\nwith a specific, identifying pattern. Here we propose an approach to tallying\nend-to-end verifiable schemes that avoids revealing all the votes but still\nachieves whatever confidence level in the announced result is desired. Now a\ncoerced voter can claim that the required vote must be amongst those that\nremained shrouded. Our approach is based on the well-established notion of\nRisk-Limiting Audits, but here applied to the tally rather than to the audit.\nWe show that this approach counters coercion threats arising in extreme tallies\nand \"Italian\" attacks. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Selene\nscheme, and we extend the approach to Risk-Limiting Verification, where not all\nvote trackers are revealed, thereby enhancing the coercion mitigation\nproperties of Selene.",

The proposed architecture automates\nthe voting workflow through RFID-enabled voter identification, encrypted vote\ncasting, and secure data transmission. Each eligible voter receives a smart\nRFID card containing a uniquely encrypted identifier, which is verified using\nan RC522 reader interfaced with a microcontroller. Upon successful\nverification, the voter interacts with a touchscreen interface to cast a vote,\nwhich is then encrypted using AES-128 and securely stored on a local SD card or\ntransmitted via GSM to a central server. A tamper-proof monitoring mechanism\nrecords each session with time-stamped digital signatures, ensuring\nauditability and data integrity. The architecture is designed to function in\nboth online and offline modes, with an automated batch synchronization\nmechanism that updates vote records once network connectivity is restored.\nSystem testing in simulated environments confirmed 100% voter authentication\naccuracy, minimized latency (average voting time of 11.5 seconds), and\nrobustness against cloning, double voting, and data interception. The\nintegration of real-time monitoring and secure process control modules enables\nelectoral authorities to automate data logging, detect anomalies, and validate\nsystem integrity dynamically.

    "abstract": "Numerous institutions, such as companies, universities, or non-governmental\norganizations, employ Internet voting for remote elections. Since the main\npurpose of an election is to determine the voters' will, it is fundamentally\nimportant to ensure that the final election result correctly reflects the\nvoters' votes. To this end, modern secure Internet voting schemes aim for what\nis called end-to-end verifiability. This fundamental security property ensures\nthat the correctness of the final result can be verified, even if some of the\ncomputers or parties involved are malfunctioning or corrupted.\n  A standard component in this approach is so called cast-as-intended\nverifiability which enables individual voters to verify that the ballots cast\non their behalf contain their intended choices. Numerous approaches for\ncast-as-intended verifiability have been proposed in the literature, some of\nwhich have also been employed in real-life Internet elections.\n  One of the well established approaches for cast-as-intended verifiability is\nto employ a second device which can be used by voters to audit their submitted\nballots. This approach offers several advantages - including support for\nflexible ballot/election types and intuitive user experience - and it has been\nused in real-life elections, for instance in Estonia.\n  In this work, we improve the existing solutions for cast-as-intended\nverifiability based on the use of a second device. We propose a solution which,\nwhile preserving the advantageous practical properties sketched above, provides\ntighter security guarantees. Our method does not increase the risk of\nvote-selling when compared to the underlying voting protocol being augmented\nand, to achieve this, it requires only comparatively weak trust assumptions. It\ncan be combined with various voting protocols, including commitment-based\nsystems offering everlasting privacy.",

    "abstract": "Quantum information allows us to build quantum money schemes, where a bank\ncan issue banknotes in the form of authenticatable quantum states that cannot\nbe cloned or counterfeited. Similar to paper banknotes, in existing quantum\nmoney schemes, a banknote consists of an unclonable quantum state and a\nclassical serial number, signed by bank. Thus, they lack one of the most\nfundamental properties cryptographers look for in a currency scheme: privacy.\nIn this work, we first further develop the formal definitions of privacy for\nquantum money schemes. Then, we construct the first public-key quantum money\nschemes that satisfy these security notions. Namely, - Assuming existence of\nindistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and hardness of Learning with Errors\n(LWE), we construct a public-key quantum money scheme with anonymity against\nusers and traceability by authorities.\n  Since it is a policy choice whether authorities should be able to track\nbanknotes or not, we also construct an untraceable money scheme from the same\ncryptographic assumptions, where no one (not even the authorities) can track\nbanknotes.\n  Further, we show that the no-cloning principle, a result of quantum\nmechanics, allows us to construct schemes, with security guarantees that are\nclassically impossible, for a seemingly unrelated application: voting! -\nAssuming iO and LWE, we construct a universally verifiable quantum voting\nscheme with classical votes.\n  Finally, as a technical tool, we introduce the notion of publicly\nrerandomizable encryption with strong correctness, where no adversary is able\nto produce a malicious ciphertext and a malicious randomness such that the\nciphertext before and after rerandomization decrypts to different values! We\nbelieve this might be of independent interest. - Assuming LWE, we construct a\n(post-quantum) classical publicly rerandomizable encryption scheme with strong\ncorrectness.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks place sensors into an area to collect data and send\nthem back to a base station. Data fusion, which fuses the collected data before\nthey are sent to the base station, is usually implemented over the network.\nSince the sensor is typically placed in locations accessible to malicious\nattackers, information assurance of the data fusion process is very important.\nA witness-based approach has been proposed to validate the fusion data. In this\napproach, the base station receives the fusion data and \"votes\" on the data\nfrom a randomly chosen sensor node. The vote comes from other sensor nodes,\ncalled \"witnesses,\" to verify the correctness of the fusion data. Because the\nbase station obtains the vote through the chosen node, the chosen node could\nforge the vote if it is compromised. Thus, the witness node must encrypt the\nvote to prevent this forgery. Compared with the vote, the encryption requires\nmore bits, increasing transmission burden from the chosen node to the base\nstation. The chosen node consumes more power. This work improves the\nwitness-based approach using direct voting mechanism such that the proposed\nscheme has better performance in terms of assurance, overhead, and delay. The\nwitness node transmits the vote directly to the base station. Forgery is not a\nproblem in this scheme. Moreover, fewer bits are necessary to represent the\nvote, significantly reducing the power consumption. Performance analysis and\nsimulation results indicate that the proposed approach can achieve a 40 times\nbetter overhead than the witness-based approach.",

    "abstract": "Voting is a means to agree on a collective decision based on available\nchoices (e.g., candidates), where participants agree to abide by their outcome.\nTo improve some features of e-voting, decentralized blockchain-based solutions\ncan be employed, where the blockchain represents a public bulletin board that\nin contrast to a centralized bulletin board provides extremely high\navailability, censorship resistance, and correct code execution. A blockchain\nensures that all entities in the voting system have the same view of the\nactions made by others due to its immutability and append-only features. The\nexisting remote blockchain-based boardroom voting solution called Open Voting\nNetwork (OVN) provides the privacy of votes, universal &amp; End-to-End\nverifiability, and perfect ballot secrecy; however, it supports only two\nchoices and lacks robustness enabling recovery from stalling participants.\n  We present BBB-Voting, an equivalent blockchain-based approach for\ndecentralized voting such as OVN, but in contrast to it, BBB-Voting supports\n1-out-of-$k$ choices and provides robustness that enables recovery from\nstalling participants. We make a cost-optimized implementation using an\nEthereum-based environment respecting Ethereum Enterprise Alliance standards,\nwhich we compare with OVN and show that our work decreases the costs for voters\nby 13.5% in normalized gas consumption. Finally, we show how BBB-Voting can be\nextended to support the number of participants limited only by the expenses\npaid by the authority and the computing power to obtain the tally.",

    "abstract": "SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with\njustifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are\nconsistent with an audit trail (\"ballots\"), which can be paper or electronic.\nSOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately\nfor each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome\nis correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;\n(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to\nprevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the\naccuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of\ncontests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping\nbetween ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs\nthat purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt\nCounty Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for\nindividual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.\nStep (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.\nObservers participate in step (3), which relies on the \"super-simple\nsimultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit.\" Step (3) is designed to reveal\nrelatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs\naccurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests\ndiffer from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is\nguaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by\nhand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official\nand final.",
