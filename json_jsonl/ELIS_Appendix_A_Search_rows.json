    "abstract": "Indian Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) will be fitted with printers that\nproduce Voter-Verifiable Paper Audit Trails (VVPATs) in time for the 2019\ngeneral election. VVPATs provide evidence that each vote was recorded as the\nvoter intended, without having to trust the perfection or security of the EVMs.\n  However, confidence in election results requires more: VVPATs must be\npreserved inviolate and then actually used to check the reported election\nresult in a trustworthy way that the public can verify. A full manual tally\nfrom the VVPATs could be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming; moreover,\nit is difficult for the public to determine whether a full hand count was\nconducted accurately. We show how Risk-Limiting Audits (RLAs) could provide\nhigh confidence in Indian election results. Compared to full hand recounts,\nRLAs typically require manually inspecting far fewer VVPATs when the outcome is\ncorrect, and are much easier for the electorate to observe in adequate detail\nto determine whether the result is trustworthy.",

This research addresses the challenge of\ncreating a secure, private e-voting system with minimized trust dependencies\ndesigned for the most versatile personal device: the smartphone. We introduce\nSmartphoneDemocracy, a novel e-voting protocol that combines three key\ntechnologies: the emerging European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet for\nSybil-resistant identity verification, Zero-Knowledge Proofs for\nprivacy-preserving validation, and a peer-to-peer blockchain (TrustChain) for a\nresilient, serverless public bulletin board.

We provide a detailed protocol design, a security analysis against\na defined threat model, and a performance evaluation demonstrating that the\ncomputational and network overhead is feasible for medium- to large-scale\nelections.

    "abstract": "Recent advances indicate that quantum computers will soon be reality.\nMotivated by this ever more realistic threat for existing classical\ncryptographic protocols, researchers have developed several schemes to resist\n\"quantum attacks\". In particular, for electronic voting, several e-voting\nschemes relying on properties of quantum mechanics have been proposed. However,\neach of these proposals comes with a different and often not well-articulated\ncorruption model, has different objectives, and is accompanied by security\nclaims which are never formalized and are at best justified only against\nspecific attacks. To address this, we propose the first formal security\ndefinitions for quantum e-voting protocols. With these at hand, we systematize\nand evaluate the security of previously-proposed quantum e-voting protocols; we\nexamine the claims of these works concerning privacy, correctness and\nverifiability, and if they are correctly attributed to the proposed protocols.\nIn all non-trivial cases, we identify specific quantum attacks that violate\nthese properties.

    "abstract": "While existing literature on electronic voting has extensively addressed\nverifiability of voting protocols, the vulnerability of electoral rolls in\nlarge public elections remains a critical concern. To ensure integrity of\nelectoral rolls, the current practice is to either make electoral rolls public\nor share them with the political parties. However, this enables construction of\ndetailed voter profiles and selective targeting and manipulation of voters,\nthereby undermining the fundamental principle of free and fair elections. In\nthis paper, we study the problem of designing publicly auditable yet\nprivacy-preserving electoral rolls. We first formulate a threat model and\nprovide formal security definitions. We then present a protocol for creation,\nmaintenance and usage of electoral rolls that mitigates the threats. Eligible\nvoters can verify their inclusion, whereas political parties and auditors can\nstatistically audit the electoral roll. Further, the audit can also detect\npolling-day ballot stuffing and denials to eligible voters by malicious polling\nofficers. The entire electoral roll is never revealed, which prevents any\nlarge-scale systematic voter targeting and manipulation.",

    "abstract": "E-voting systems have emerged as a powerful technology for improving\ndemocracy by reducing election cost, increasing voter participation, and even\nallowing voters to directly verify the entire election procedure. Prior\ninternet voting systems have single points of failure, which may result in the\ncompromise of availability, voter secrecy, or integrity of the election\nresults. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, security\nanalysis, and evaluation of D-DEMOS, a complete e-voting system that is\ndistributed, privacy-preserving and end-to-end verifiable. Our system includes\na fully asynchronous vote collection subsystem that provides immediate\nassurance to the voter her vote was recorded as cast, without requiring\ncryptographic operations on behalf of the voter. We also include a distributed,\nreplicated and fault-tolerant Bulletin Board component, that stores all\nnecessary election-related information, and allows any party to read and verify\nthe complete election process. Finally, we also incorporate trustees, i.e.,\nindividuals who control election result production while guaranteeing privacy\nand end-to-end-verifiability as long as their strong majority is honest. Our\nsystem is the first e-voting system whose voting operation is human verifiable,\ni.e., a voter can vote over the web, even when her web client stack is\npotentially unsafe, without sacrificing her privacy, and still be assured her\nvote was recorded as cast. Additionally, a voter can outsource election\nauditing to third parties, still without sacrificing privacy. Finally, as the\nnumber of auditors increases, the probability of election fraud going\nundetected is diminished exponentially. We provide a model and security\nanalysis of the system. We implement a prototype of the complete system, we\nmeasure its performance experimentally, and we demonstrate its ability to\nhandle large-scale elections.",

    "abstract": "Digital societies increasingly rely on trustworthy proofs of physical\npresence for services such as supply-chain tracking, e-voting, ride-sharing,\nand location-based rewards. Yet, traditional localization methods often lack\ncryptographic guarantees of where and when an entity was present, leaving them\nvulnerable to spoofing, replay, or collusion attacks. In response, research on\nProof-of-Location (PoL) has emerged, with recent approaches combining distance\nbounding, distributed consensus, and privacy-enhancing techniques to enable\nverifiable, tamper-resistant location claims.\n  As the design space for PoL systems grows in complexity, this paper provides\na unified framework to help practitioners navigate diverse application needs.\nWe first propose a taxonomy identifying four core domains: (1) cryptographic\nguarantees, (2) spatio-temporal synchronization, (3) trust and witness models,\nand (4) interaction and overhead. Building on this, we introduce a methodology\nto map application-specific requirements onto appropriate PoL architectures. We\nillustrate this process through three use cases (retail e-coupons, supply chain\nauditing, and physical e-voting), each showing how different constraints shape\nprotocol choices. Overall, this work offers a structured approach to building\nsecure, scalable, and interoperable PoL systems.",

    "abstract": "E-voting systems are a powerful technology for improving democracy.\nUnfortunately, prior voting systems have single points-of-failure, which may\ncompromise availability, privacy, or integrity of the election results.\n  We present the design, implementation, security analysis, and evaluation of\nthe D-DEMOS suite of distributed, privacy-preserving, and end-to-end verifiable\ne-voting systems. We present two systems: one asynchronous and one with minimal\ntiming assumptions but better performance. Our systems include a distributed\nvote collection subsystem that does not require cryptographic operations on\nbehalf of the voter. We also include a distributed, replicated and\nfault-tolerant Bulletin Board component, that stores all necessary\nelection-related information, and allows any party to read and verify the\ncomplete election process. Finally, we incorporate trustees, who control result\nproduction while guaranteeing privacy and end-to-end-verifiability as long as\ntheir strong majority is honest.\n  Our suite of e-voting systems are the first whose voting operation is human\nverifiable, i.e., a voter can vote over the web, even when her web client stack\nis potentially unsafe, without sacrificing her privacy, and still be assured\nher vote was recorded as cast. Additionally, a voter can outsource election\nauditing to third parties, still without sacrificing privacy.\n  We provide a model and security analysis of the systems, implement complete\nprototypes, measure their performance experimentally, and demonstrate their\nability to handle large-scale elections. Finally, we demonstrate the\nperformance trade-offs between the two versions of the system. A preliminary\nversion of our system was used to conduct exit-polls at three voting sites for\ntwo national-level elections and is being adopted for use by the largest civil\nunion of workers in Greece, consisting of over a half million members.",

    "abstract": "In traditional e-voting protocols, privacy is often provided by a trusted\nauthority that learns the votes and computes the tally. Some protocols replace\nthe trusted authority by a set of authorities, and privacy is guaranteed if\nless than a threshold number of authorities are corrupt. For verifiability,\nstronger security guarantees are demanded. Typically, corrupt authorities that\ntry to fake the result of the tally must always be detected.\n  To provide verifiability, many e-voting protocols use Non-Interactive\nZero-Knowledge proofs (NIZKs). Thanks to their non-interactive nature, NIZKs\nallow anybody, including third parties that do not participate in the protocol,\nto verify the correctness of the tally. Therefore, NIZKs can be used to obtain\nuniversal verifiability. Additionally, NIZKs also improve usability because\nthey allow voters to cast a vote using a non-interactive protocol.\n  The disadvantage of NIZKs is that their security is based on setup\nassumptions such as the common reference string (CRS) or the random oracle (RO)\nmodel. The former requires a trusted party for the generation of a common\nreference string. The latter, though a popular methodology for designing secure\nprotocols, has been shown to be unsound.\n  In this paper, we address the design of an e-voting protocol that provides\nverifiability without any trust assumptions, where verifiability here is meant\nwithout eligibility verification. We show that Non-Interactive\nWitness-Indistinguishable proofs (NIWI) can be used for this purpose. The\ne-voting scheme is private under the Decision Linear assumption, while\nverifiability holds unconditionally. To our knowledge, this is the first\nprivate e-voting scheme with perfect universal verifiability, i.e. one in which\nthe probability of a fake tally not being detected is 0, and with {\\em\nnon-interactive} protocols that does not rely on trust assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) are rigorous statistical procedures meant to\ndetect invalid election results. RLAs examine paper ballots cast during the\nelection to statistically assess the possibility of a disagreement between the\nwinner determined by the ballots and the winner reported by tabulation. The\nmost ballot efficient approaches proceed by \"ballot comparison.\" However,\nballot comparison requires an untrusted declaration of the contents of each\ncast ballot, rather than a simple tabulation of vote totals. This \"cast-vote\nrecord table\" (CVR) is then spot-checked against ballots for consistency. In\nmany practical settings, the cost of generating a suitable CVR dominates the\ncost of conducting the audit, preventing widespread adoption of these\nsample-efficient techniques.\n  We introduce a new RLA procedure: an \"adaptive ballot comparison\" audit. In\nthis audit, a global CVR is never produced; instead, a three-stage procedure is\niterated:\n  1) a batch is selected,\n  2) a CVR is produced for that batch, and\n  3) a ballot within the batch is sampled, inspected by auditors, and compared\nwith the CVR.\n  We prove that such an audit can achieve risk commensurate with standard\ncomparison audits while generating a fraction of the CVR. We present three main\ncontributions:\n  1) a formal adversarial model for RLAs;\n  2) definition and analysis of an adaptive audit procedure with rigorous risk\nlimits and an associated correctness analysis accounting for the incidental\nerrors arising in typical audits; and\n  3) an analysis of practical efficiency.\n  This method can be organized in rounds (as is typical for comparison audits)\nwhere sampled CVRs are produced in parallel. Using data from Florida's 2020\npresidential election with 5% risk and 1% margin, only 22% of the CVR is\ngenerated; at 10% margin, only 2% is generated.",

    "abstract": "Internet voting will probably be one of the most significant achievements of\nthe future information society. It will have an enormous impact on the election\nprocess making it fast, reliable and inexpensive. Nonetheless, so far remote\nvoting is considered to be very difficult, as one has to take into account\nsusceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most\nthe research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site\nelectronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they\ncannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform\nproblem. However, the cryptographic components they utilize may be very useful.\nThis paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic\nencryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques\nrecommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol\ntries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible\nfor manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper\nballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations\n(lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes,\nis performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme\nis characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the\nserver side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the\nvoter's side, and offers distributed trust, receipt-freeness and verifiability.",

    "abstract": "Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) offer a statistical guarantee: if a full manual\ntally of the paper ballots would show that the reported election outcome is\nwrong, an RLA has a known minimum chance of leading to a full manual tally.\nRLAs generally rely on random samples. Stratified sampling--partitioning the\npopulation of ballots into disjoint strata and sampling independently from the\nstrata--may simplify logistics or increase efficiency compared to simpler\nsampling designs, but makes risk calculations harder. We present SUITE, a new\nmethod for conducting RLAs using stratified samples. SUITE considers all\npossible partitions of outcome-changing error across strata. For each\npartition, it combines P-values from stratum-level tests into a combined\nP-value; there is no restriction on the tests used in different strata. SUITE\nmaximizes the combined P-value over all partitions of outcome-changing error.\nThe audit can stop if that maximum is less than the risk limit. Voting systems\nin some Colorado counties (comprising 98.2% of voters) allow auditors to check\nhow the system interpreted each ballot, which allows ballot-level comparison\nRLAs. Other counties use ballot polling, which is less efficient. Extant\napproaches to conducting an RLA of a statewide contest would require major\nchanges to Colorado's procedures and software, or would sacrifice the\nefficiency of ballot-level comparison. SUITE does not. It divides ballots into\ntwo strata: those cast in counties that can conduct ballot-level comparisons,\nand the rest. Stratum-level P-values are found by methods derived here. The\nresulting audit is substantially more efficient than statewide ballot polling.\nSUITE is useful in any state with a mix of voting systems or that uses\nstratified sampling for other reasons.

    "abstract": "Transparency and security are essential in our voting system, and voting\nmachines. This paper describes an implementation of a stateless, transparent\nvoting machine (STVM). The STVM is a ballot marking device (BMD) that uses a\ntransparent, interactive printing interface where voters can verify their paper\nballots as they fill out the ballot. The transparent interface turns the paper\nballot into an interactive interface. In this architecture, stateless describes\nthe machine's boot sequence, where no information is stored or passed forward\nbetween reboots. The machine does not have a hard drive. Instead, it boots and\nruns from read-only media. This STVM design utilizes a Blu-ray Disc ROM (BD-R)\nto boot the voting software. This system's statelessness and the transparent\ninteractive printing interface make this design the most secure BMD for voting.\nUnlike other voting methods, this system incorporates high usability,\naccessibility, and security for all voters. The STVM uses an open-source voting\nsystem that has a universally designed interface, making the system accessible\nfor all voters independent of their ability or disability. This system can make\nvoting safer by simultaneously addressing the issue of voters noticing a vote\nflip and making it difficult for a hack to persist or go unmitigated.",

After the polls close, each voter verifies that this table lists their\n(P,V) pair and that the tally is computed correctly. The system is especially\nappropriate for any small group making sensitive decisions. Because the system\nwould not prevent a coercer from demanding that their victim use a specified\npassphrase, it is not designed for applications where such malfeasance would be\nlikely or go undetected. Results from 43 voters show that the system was\nwell-accepted, performed effectively for its intended purpose, and introduced\nusers to the concept of voter-verified elections.

    "abstract": "Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting\nincorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most\nefficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's\ninterpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,\nCVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same\ncards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in\na way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to\nrepresent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in\nwhich they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.\nBut for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote\nanonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast\nthem. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (\"cryptographic nonce\") on each\nballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.\nBut what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or\ndoes not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to\nconduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on\neach ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not\ncompromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method\nallows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.\nThe method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection\ndoes not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system\nmisbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results\nwhen the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and\nretrieval were accurate.",

A dispute can be resolved if any third party can\nunambiguously determine who is right. We systematically characterize all\nrelevant disputes for a generic, practically relevant, class of voting\nprotocols. Based on our characterization, we propose a new definition of\ndispute resolution for voting that accounts for the possibility that both\nvoters and the voting authority can make false claims and that voters may\nabstain from voting.\n  A central aspect of our work is timeliness: a voter should possess the\nevidence required to resolve disputes no later than the election's end. We\ncharacterize what assumptions are necessary and sufficient for timeliness in\nterms of a communication topology for our voting protocol class. We formalize\nthe dispute resolution properties and communication topologies symbolically.\nThis provides the basis for verification of dispute resolution for a broad\nclass of protocols. To demonstrate the utility of our model, we analyze a\nmixnet-based voting protocol and prove that it satisfies dispute resolution as\nwell as verifiability and receipt-freeness.

So far, the combination of ballot stuffing and\nparticipation privacy has been mostly studied for internet voting, where voters\nare assumed to own trusted computing devices. Such approaches are inapplicable\nto pollsite voting where voters typically vote bare handed. We present an\neligibility audit protocol to detect ballot stuffing in pollsite voting\nprotocols.

Our\nprotocol can be instantiated as an additional layer on top of most existing\npollsite E2E-V voting protocols.

    "abstract": "We propose a protocol for verifiable remote voting with paper assurance. It\nis intended to augment existing postal voting procedures, allowing a ballot to\nbe electronically constructed, printed on paper, then returned in the post. It\nallows each voter to verify that their vote has been correctly cast, recorded\nand tallied by the Electoral Commission. The system is not end-to-end\nverifiable, but does allow voters to detect manipulation by an adversary who\ncontrols either the voting device, or (the postal service and electoral\ncommission) but not both. The protocol is not receipt-free, but if the client\nhonestly follows the protocol (including possibly remembering everything), they\ncannot subsequently prove how they voted. Our proposal is the first to combine\nplain paper assurance with cryptographic verification in a (passively)\nreceipt-free manner.",

    "abstract": "A boardroom election is an election with a small number of voters carried out\nwith public communications. We present BVOT, a self-tallying boardroom voting\nprotocol with ballot secrecy, fairness (no tally information is available\nbefore the polls close), and dispute-freeness (voters can observe that all\nvoters correctly followed the protocol).\n  BVOT works by using a multiparty threshold homomorphic encryption system in\nwhich each candidate is associated with a masked unique prime. Each voter\nengages in an oblivious transfer with an untrusted distributor: the voter\nselects the index of a prime associated with a candidate and receives the\nselected prime in masked form. The voter then casts their vote by encrypting\ntheir masked prime and broadcasting it to everyone. The distributor does not\nlearn the voter's choice, and no one learns the mapping between primes and\ncandidates until the audit phase. By hiding the mapping between primes and\ncandidates, BVOT provides voters with insufficient information to carry out\neffective cheating. The threshold feature prevents anyone from computing any\npartial tally---until everyone has voted. Multiplying all votes, their\ndecryption shares, and the unmasking factor yields a product of the primes each\nraised to the number of votes received.\n  In contrast to some existing boardroom voting protocols, BVOT does not rely\non any zero-knowledge proof; instead, it uses oblivious transfer to assure\nballot secrecy and correct vote casting. Also, BVOT can handle multiple\ncandidates in one election. BVOT prevents cheating by hiding crucial\ninformation: an attempt to increase the tally of one candidate might increase\nthe tally of another candidate. After all votes are cast, any party can tally\nthe votes.",

    "abstract": "In a world where elections touch every aspect of society, the need for secure\nvoting is paramount. Traditional safeguards, based on classical cryptography,\nrely on complex math problems like factoring large numbers. However, quantum\ncomputing is changing the game. Recent advances in quantum technology suggest\nthat classical cryptographic methods may not be as secure as we thought. This\npaper introduces a quantum voting protocol, a blend of quantum principles\n(entanglement and superposition), blockchain technology, and digital\nsignatures, all powered by $\\log_2{n}$ qubits, and designed for approval voting\nwith n candidates. The result is a symphony of security features - binding,\nanonymity, non-reusability, verifiability, eligibility, and fairness - that\nchart a new course for voting security. The real world beckons, as we tested\nthis protocol on IBM quantum hardware, achieving impressively low error rates\nof just 1.17% in a four-candidate election.",
