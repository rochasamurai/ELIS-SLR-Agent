    "abstract": "While existing literature on electronic voting has extensively addressed verifiability of voting protocols, the vulnerability of electoral rolls in large public elections remains a critical concern. To ensure integrity of electoral rolls, the current practice is to either make electoral rolls public or share them with the political parties. However, this enables construction of detailed voter profiles and selective targeting and manipulation of voters, thereby undermining the fundamental principle of free and fair elections. In this paper, we study the problem of designing publicly auditable yet privacy-preserving electoral rolls. We first formulate a threat model and provide formal security definitions. We then present a protocol for creation, maintenance and usage of electoral rolls that mitigates the threats. Eligible voters can verify their inclusion, whereas political parties and auditors can statistically audit the electoral roll. Further, the audit can also detect polling-day ballot stuffing and denials to eligible voters by malicious polling officers. The entire electoral roll is never revealed, which prevents any large-scale systematic voter targeting and manipulation.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the development of a process automation architecture leveraging Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for secure, transparent and efficient voting systems. The proposed architecture automates the voting workflow through RFID-enabled voter identification, encrypted vote casting, and secure data transmission. Each eligible voter receives a smart RFID card containing a uniquely encrypted identifier, which is verified using an RC522 reader interfaced with a microcontroller. Upon successful verification, the voter interacts with a touchscreen interface to cast a vote, which is then encrypted using AES-128 and securely stored on a local SD card or transmitted via GSM to a central server. A tamper-proof monitoring mechanism records each session with time-stamped digital signatures, ensuring auditability and data integrity. The architecture is designed to function in both online and offline modes, with an automated batch synchronization mechanism that updates vote records once network connectivity is restored. System testing in simulated environments confirmed 100% voter authentication accuracy, minimized latency (average voting time of 11.5 seconds), and robustness against cloning, double voting, and data interception. The integration of real-time monitoring and secure process control modules enables electoral authorities to automate data logging, detect anomalies, and validate system integrity dynamically. This work demonstrates a scalable, automation-driven solution for voting infrastructure, offering enhanced transparency, resilience, and deployment flexibility, especially in environments where digital transformation of electoral processes is critically needed.",

    "abstract": "Selene is an e-voting protocol that allows voters to directly check their individual vote, in cleartext, in the final tally via a tracker system, while providing good coercion mitigation. This is in contrast to conventional, end-to-end verifiable schemes in which the voter verifies the presence of an encryption of her vote on the bulletin board. The Selene mechanism can be applied to many e-voting schemes, but here we present an application to the polling station context, resulting in a voter-verifiable electronic tally with a paper audit trail. The system uses a smartcard-based public key system to provide the individual verification and universal eligibility verifiability. The paper record contains an encrypted link to the voter's identity, requiring stronger assumptions on ballot privacy than normal paper voting, but with the benefit of providing good auditability and dispute resolution as well as supporting (comparison) risk limiting audits.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances indicate that quantum computers will soon be reality. Motivated by this ever more realistic threat for existing classical cryptographic protocols, researchers have developed several schemes to resist \"quantum attacks\". In particular, for electronic voting, several e-voting schemes relying on properties of quantum mechanics have been proposed. However, each of these proposals comes with a different and often not well-articulated corruption model, has different objectives, and is accompanied by security claims which are never formalized and are at best justified only against specific attacks. To address this, we propose the first formal security definitions for quantum e-voting protocols. With these at hand, we systematize and evaluate the security of previously-proposed quantum e-voting protocols; we examine the claims of these works concerning privacy, correctness and verifiability, and if they are correctly attributed to the proposed protocols. In all non-trivial cases, we identify specific quantum attacks that violate these properties. We argue that the cause of these failures lies in the absence of formal security models and references to the existing cryptographic literature.",

    "abstract": "An election audit is risk-limiting if the audit limits (to a pre-specified threshold) the chance that an erroneous electoral outcome will be certified. Extant methods for auditing instant-runoff voting (IRV) elections are either not risk-limiting or require cast vote records (CVRs), the voting system's electronic record of the votes on each ballot. CVRs are not always available, for instance, in jurisdictions that tabulate IRV contests manually.\n  We develop an RLA method (AWAIRE) that uses adaptively weighted averages of test supermartingales to efficiently audit IRV elections when CVRs are not available. The adaptive weighting 'learns' an efficient set of hypotheses to test to confirm the election outcome. When accurate CVRs are available, AWAIRE can use them to increase the efficiency to match the performance of existing methods that require CVRs.\n  We provide an open-source prototype implementation that can handle elections with up to six candidates. Simulations using data from real elections show that AWAIRE is likely to be efficient in practice. We discuss how to extend the computational approach to handle elections with more candidates.\n  Adaptively weighted averages of test supermartingales are a general tool, useful beyond election audits to test collections of hypotheses sequentially while rigorously controlling the familywise error rate.",

    "abstract": "Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) are rigorous statistical procedures meant to detect invalid election results. RLAs examine paper ballots cast during the election to statistically assess the possibility of a disagreement between the winner determined by the ballots and the winner reported by tabulation. The most ballot efficient approaches proceed by \"ballot comparison.\" However, ballot comparison requires an untrusted declaration of the contents of each cast ballot, rather than a simple tabulation of vote totals. This \"cast-vote record table\" (CVR) is then spot-checked against ballots for consistency. In many practical settings, the cost of generating a suitable CVR dominates the cost of conducting the audit, preventing widespread adoption of these sample-efficient techniques.\n  We introduce a new RLA procedure: an \"adaptive ballot comparison\" audit. In this audit, a global CVR is never produced; instead, a three-stage procedure is iterated:\n  1) a batch is selected,\n  2) a CVR is produced for that batch, and\n  3) a ballot within the batch is sampled, inspected by auditors, and compared with the CVR.\n  We prove that such an audit can achieve risk commensurate with standard comparison audits while generating a fraction of the CVR. We present three main contributions:\n  1) a formal adversarial model for RLAs;\n  2) definition and analysis of an adaptive audit procedure with rigorous risk limits and an associated correctness analysis accounting for the incidental errors arising in typical audits; and\n  3) an analysis of practical efficiency.\n  This method can be organized in rounds (as is typical for comparison audits) where sampled CVRs are produced in parallel. Using data from Florida's 2020 presidential election with 5% risk and 1% margin, only 22% of the CVR is generated; at 10% margin, only 2% is generated.",

    "abstract": "Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records, CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot. But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (\"cryptographic nonce\") on each ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks. But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards. The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and retrieval were accurate.",

Ballot-polling audits select ballots at random and interpret those ballots as evidence for and against the reported result, continuing this process until either they support the recorded result, or they fall back to a full manual recount. For elections with digitised scanning and counting of ballots, a comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper versions. Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections.

    "abstract": "Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) are expected to strengthen the public confidence in the correctness of an election outcome. We hypothesize that this is not always the case, in part because for large margins between the winner and the runner-up, the number of ballots to be drawn can be so small that voters lose confidence. We conduct a user study with 105 participants resident in the US. Our findings confirm the hypothesis, showing that our study participants felt less confident when they were told the number of ballots audited for RLAs. We elaborate on our findings and propose recommendations for future use of RLAs.",

    "abstract": "SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are consistent with an audit trail (\"ballots\"), which can be paper or electronic. SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy; (2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy. Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials. Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the \"super-simple simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit.\" Step (3) is designed to reveal relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official and final.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the complex dynamics of trust and distrust in digital government technologies by approaching the cancellation of machine voting in the Netherlands (2006-07). This case describes how a previously trusted system can collapse, how paradoxical the relationship between trust and distrust is, and how it interacts with adopting and managing electoral technologies. The analysis stresses how, although being a central component, technology's trustworthiness dialogues with the socio-technical context in which it is inserted, for example, underscoring the relevance of public administration in securing technological environments. Beyond these insights, the research offers broader reflections on trust and distrust in data-driven technologies, advocating for differentiated strategies for building trust versus managing distrust. Overall, this paper contributes to understanding trust dynamics in digital government technologies, with implications for policymaking and technology adoption strategies.",

In addition, this thesis presents the results of a cross-sectional survey of Australian voters regarding levels of trust for three voting systems: the existing paper-based system used for Australian federal elections, the iVote WA system, and the vVote system used for the 2014 Victorian State Election.\n  The analysis of iVote, combined with the survey results, are used to inform a recommendation for future research and public policy regarding the use of electronic voting systems in Australian federal elections.",

Risk-limiting audits (RLA) are statistically principled \"incremental\" hand counts that provide statistical assurance that reported outcomes accurately reflect the validly cast votes. We present a suite of tools for conducting RLAs using confidence sequences -- sequences of confidence sets which uniformly capture an electoral parameter of interest from the start of an audit to the point of an exhaustive recount with high probability. Adopting the SHANGRLA framework, we design nonnegative martingales which yield computationally and statistically efficient confidence sequences and RLAs for a wide variety of election types.",

    "abstract": "A boardroom election is an election that takes place in a single room -- the boardroom -- in which all voters can see and hear each other. We present an initial exploration of boardroom elections with ballot privacy and voter verifiability that use only \"low-tech cryptography\" without using computers to mark or collect ballots. Specifically, we define the problem, introduce several building blocks, and propose a new protocol that combines these blocks in novel ways. Our new building blocks include \"foldable ballots\" that can be rotated to hide the alignment of ballot choices with voting marks, and \"visual secrets\" that are easy to remember and use but hard to describe. Although closely seated participants in a boardroom election have limited privacy, the protocol ensures that no one can determine how others voted. Moreover, each voter can verify that their ballot was correctly cast, collected, and counted, without being able to prove how they voted, providing assurance against undue influence. Low-tech cryptography is useful in situations where constituents do not trust computer technology, and it avoids the complex auditing requirements of end-to-end cryptographic voting systems such as Prêt-à-Voter. This paper's building blocks and protocol are meant to be a proof of concept that might be tested for usability and improved.",
