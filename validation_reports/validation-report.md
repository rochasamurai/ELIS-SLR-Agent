For verifiability,\nstronger security guarantees are demanded. Typically, corrupt authorities that\ntry to fake the result of the tally must always be detected.\n  To provide verifiability, many e-voting protocols use Non-Interactive\nZero-Knowledge proofs (NIZKs). Thanks to their non-interactive nature, NIZKs\nallow anybody, including third parties that do not participate in the protocol,\nto verify the correctness of the tally. Therefore, NIZKs can be used to obtain\nuniversal verifiability. Additionally, NIZKs also improve usability because\nthey allow voters to cast a vote using a non-interactive protocol.\n  The disadvantage of NIZKs is that their security is based on setup\nassumptions such as the common reference string (CRS) or the random oracle (RO)\nmodel.

One of the main challenges in e-voting systems is to\nsecure the voting process: namely, to certify that the computed results are\nconsistent with the cast ballots and that the voters' privacy is preserved. We\npropose herein a secure voting protocol for elections that are governed by\norder-based voting rules. Our protocol, in which the tallying task is\ndistributed among several independent talliers, offers perfect ballot secrecy\nin the sense that it issues only the required output while no other information\non the cast ballots is revealed. Such perfect secrecy, achieved by employing\nsecure multiparty computation tools, may increase the voters' confidence and,\nconsequently, encourage them to vote according to their true preferences.

We systematically characterize all\nrelevant disputes for a generic, practically relevant, class of voting\nprotocols. Based on our characterization, we propose a new definition of\ndispute resolution for voting that accounts for the possibility that both\nvoters and the voting authority can make false claims and that voters may\nabstain from voting.\n  A central aspect of our work is timeliness: a voter should possess the\nevidence required to resolve disputes no later than the election's end. We\ncharacterize what assumptions are necessary and sufficient for timeliness in\nterms of a communication topology for our voting protocol class. We formalize\nthe dispute resolution properties and communication topologies symbolically.\nThis provides the basis for verification of dispute resolution for a broad\nclass of protocols.
