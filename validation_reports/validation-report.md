However, achieving coercion resistance while simultaneously guaranteeing election verifiability and scalability remains a significant challenge in electronic voting systems. In response to these challenges, we propose LOKI Vote, a blockchain-based e-voting protocol designed to ensure strong coercion resistance while guaranteeing all the requirements of a secure and democratic election. LOKI Vote employs advanced cryptographic mechanisms, including Zero-Knowledge Proofs, the Modified El-Gamal Cryptosystem, and BBS Group Signatures. It integrates the LLARP mix network, providing anonymous, low-latency communication between voters and election authorities. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures immutability and public verifiability, allowing anyone to audit the process without compromising voter anonymity. Additionally, we conduct an informal security assessment against a list of security requirements including voters’ eligibility, fairness, verifiability and data integrity. We then formally verify the protocol’s security using ProVerif and Applied Pi-Calculus, demonstrating that it guarantees ballot secrecy, voter authentication, and vote privacy. We implement our proposed approach and evaluate its performance in terms of execution time, cost, and scalability. The results show the protocol’s efficiency. Finally, we simulate a real-world election using LOKI Vote to validate its practicality. Our findings demonstrate that it scales efficiently to millions of voters, significantly reducing vote tallying time. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'language': 'english', 'url': 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105008687305&doi=10.1007%2Fs42979-025-04088-w&partnerID=40&md5=b69e9188babc7f06d4ec532ccd701939', 'doc_type': None, 'source': 'scopus', 'source_id': '2-s2.0-105008687305', 'query_topic': 'scopus_ui_manual', 'query_string': 'TITLE-ABS-KEY(("electoral integrity" OR "e-voting" OR "electronic voting" OR "ballot auditability" OR "voting trust") AND ("VVPAT" OR "end-to-end verifiability" OR "risk-limiting audit" OR "cryptographic" OR "blockchain") AND (evaluation OR "empirical study" OR "comparative analysis")) AND PUBYEAR > 1989 AND LANGUAGE(english)', 'retrieved_at': '2025-11-03T15:54:10Z', 'id': 'doi:10.1007/s42979-025-04088-w', '_stable_id': 'doi:10.1007/s42979-025-04088-w'} is not of type 'array'

Nevertheless, concerns about the disclosure of sensitive information and the potential compromise of voter privacy might be raised by the transparency of Blockchain (BC)-centric systems. For overcoming these challenges, an Efficient E-Voting System with a QR Code using Blockchain (EVS-QCB) is proposed in this research. To strike a balance between transparency and privacy, the proposed approach incorporates an authority management mechanism. The proposed E-Voting system includes a QR code-based multi-factor authentication mechanism, unlike conventional single-factor authentication system, reducing the risk of credential theft. The system begins with the Voter Registration Phase, where the voters register to the E-Voting system. For selecting relevant attributes from voter details, the system uses a Linear Scaling-based Fox Hunting Optimization Algorithm (LS-FHOA). Next, QR codes and smart contracts are generated and stored in a secure database. Voters authenticate through usernames, passwords, and QR codes during the voting phase, and the system ensures eligibility and prevents duplicate voting utilizing Smart Contracts. Using the Public key raised to the Power of Private key-Elliptic Curve Cryptography (P3-ECC) algorithm, the voting details are encrypted. Utilizing the Exponential Fast Fourier Transformation- Single-Window Iterative Fast Fourier Transform (EFFT-SWIFFT) hashing technique, the encrypted data is transformed into a unique hash code. The generated hash codes are securely stored in BC technology. During the vote counting time, the voting details are fetched from the BC and processed for determining the final results. Performance evaluations demonstrate superior execution time, security, and memory usage compared to baseline models.

With the ongoing evolution of communication technology and the Internet of Things, the importance of electronic voting protocols is anticipated to experience a significant rise in the advancement of smart cities. Leveraging the blockchain's tamper-resistant and publicly verifiable properties, along with the concept of enabling all participants to tally election results, blockchain-based self-tallying voting protocols effectively address the shortcomings of centralized traditional electronic voting. However, existing voting protocols still face the dual challenge of security and efficiency. The primary issues include the difficulty in ensuring voter anonymity and election fairness, as well as the insufficient system robustness and low tallying efficiency resulting from security design. To tackle these concerns, we propose a novel approach to constructing efficient and flexible voting protocols that concurrently ensure fairness and anonymity. Specifically, we encapsulate the decryption private keys corresponding to the public keys of encrypted ballots in time capsules to safeguard voting fairness. Additionally, based on our proposed approach, we construct an efficient and flexible score voting protocol for smart cities. The protocol employs traceable ring signature to protect the voter anonymity and public traceability, utilizes a dual-key additive homomorphic ElGamal encryption to encapsulate ballots. We also improve signature-based set membership proofs to verify the validity of ballots. Furthermore, through security analysis and performance evaluation, we demonstrate that our proposed protocol meets all security objectives with reasonable costs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.", 'language': 'english', 'url': 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207291990&doi=10.1109%2FJIOT.2024.3478231&partnerID=40&md5=1067c0c9a065ff1fd46c8e9ceb8ad9e1', 'doc_type': None, 'source': 'scopus', 'source_id': '2-s2.0-85207291990', 'query_topic': 'scopus_ui_manual', 'query_string': 'TITLE-ABS-KEY(("electoral integrity" OR "e-voting" OR "electronic voting" OR "ballot auditability" OR "voting trust") AND ("VVPAT" OR "end-to-end verifiability" OR "risk-limiting audit" OR "cryptographic" OR "blockchain") AND (evaluation OR "empirical study" OR "comparative analysis")) AND PUBYEAR > 1989 AND LANGUAGE(english)', 'retrieved_at': '2025-11-03T15:54:10Z', 'id': 'doi:10.1109/jiot.2024.3478231', '_stable_id': 'doi:10.1109/jiot.2024.3478231'} is not of type 'array'

As digital voting systems are increasingly being investigated worldwide, ensuring the integrity of the process using robust security measures is of great importance. This paper presents a simplified model to enhance electoral integrity by leveraging Blockchain technology in the context of Oman’s digital voting system. The model uses Blockchain technology to create a secure and trustworthy voting environment, addressing key vulnerabilities in digital electoral systems. Methods: The research utilized a quantitative approach, employing an experimental design methodology using open-source software to simulate voting systems. Synthetic population data is used to operate these systems, while advanced biometric authentication technologies verify voter identities. Blockchain technology is leveraged to ensure secure vote recording, with smart contracts used to authenticate voters and securely record votes. Additionally, synchronous transactions are executed for both voter registration and voting processes, enhancing the overall security and efficiency of the system. Results: The experimental results show that Blockchain enhances electoral integrity and security in Oman’s voting system, improving elections’ transparency and reliability. The performance evaluation of the model focuses on efficiency, reliability, and scalability metrics. Asynchronous transactions are utilized to improve processing time for voter registration and voting. Election administrators can manage, monitor, and certify election results, while Ethereum nodes ensure decentralized verification and transparency in the voting process. Conclusion: This research offers insights for policymakers to consider Blockchain for electoral reforms, addressing issues like data integrity, fraud prevention, and transparency to boost voter trust. A strong regulatory framework and public awareness are crucial for successful implementation. Pilot projects are needed to assess Blockchain’s practical impact.

We present PQR-HAC, a novel hybrid blockchain e-voting architecture that addresses these critical deficiencies through advanced sharding mechanisms and post-quantum cryptographic protocols. Our system employs geographically distributed blockchain shards that reduce transaction latency by 40% while supporting large-scale electoral operations. A custom multiparty computation (MPC) protocol generates anonymized voter tokens, effectively preventing coercion and duplicate voting while preserving voter privacy integrity. Performance evaluation using real-world election datasets demonstrates that PQR-HAC achieves 3.2times higher transaction throughput compared to existing blockchain voting implementations, establishing its feasibility for national-scale deployment.

This setup must be transparent to maintain the integrity of the election. A crucial aspect of this trusted setup involves generating group generators for a finite cyclic group, which are then used in cryptographic algorithms deployed within the voting system. Although computing group generators is generally not considered a difficult problem, election verifiability – where every step can be ascertained by independent third parties – excludes many of them, as they fail to provide verifiable evidence of correctness. In this work, we present a formally verified implementation of the group generator algorithm A.2.3 and the group generator verification algorithm A.2.4, specified in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), FIPS 186-4, in the Coq theorem prover. These two algorithms are highly sought-after methods to compute and verify group generator(s), respectively, because their outcomes can be established independently by third parties. Our formalisation captures all the requirements specified in algorithms A.2.3 and A.2.4 using the expressive type system of the Coq theorem prover. We evaluate the group generator algorithm within the Coq theorem prover itself to produce group generators, thereby only trusting the Coq theorem prover and its evaluation mechanism.

However, current systems face significant challenges related to robustness, fault tolerance, and efficient communication management. This paper introduces SRFACS (Secure and Robust Framework for Anonymous Communication Systems), designed to address these issues by integrating advanced cryptographic techniques with a structured communication framework. Traditional anonymous communication systems usually lack sufficient fault tolerance, making them vulnerable to node failures, especially in asynchronous environments. In order to overcome these limitations and ensure that the system can keep running in the event of node failure (especially in an asynchronous environment), SRFACS integrates an improved asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (ABFT) protocol. We use this protocol to expand the traditional single communication node into a structured node group, and handle up to (n − 1)/3 faulty nodes in these groups, so as to enhance fault tolerance and maintain continuous operation. To efficiently manage inter-group communication, SRFACS utilizes leader nodes to coordinate and streamline the communication processes. To mitigate the risks associated with leader failures, we have implemented an efficient leader change protocol that promptly replaces defective leaders, ensuring uninterrupted system performance. Additionally, to prevent erroneous leader actions from compromising the system, we have introduced an advanced multi-signature scheme. This approach secures communication by requiring multiple signatures for verification processes. Furthermore, we have implemented a reputation incentive mechanism to encourage nodes to maintain optimal performance and avoid malicious behavior. This mechanism evaluates nodes according to their past activities and reliability to achieve dynamic updates of SRFACS node groups. We have conducted rigorous security analyses and component performance evaluations of SRFACS, further confirming its potential as a promising secure communication solution. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'language': 'english', 'url': 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210722400&doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0312817&partnerID=40&md5=de32ce6e831aa32594df35bb8f0a12cb', 'doc_type': None, 'source': 'scopus', 'source_id': '2-s2.0-85210722400', 'query_topic': 'scopus_ui_manual', 'query_string': 'TITLE-ABS-KEY(("electoral integrity" OR "e-voting" OR "electronic voting" OR "ballot auditability" OR "voting trust") AND ("VVPAT" OR "end-to-end verifiability" OR "risk-limiting audit" OR "cryptographic" OR "blockchain") AND (evaluation OR "empirical study" OR "comparative analysis")) AND PUBYEAR > 1989 AND LANGUAGE(english)', 'retrieved_at': '2025-11-03T15:54:10Z', 'id': 'doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0312817', '_stable_id': 'doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0312817'} is not of type 'array'

Secure electronic voting is a vision for the future of elections and referendums. Such a system can counteract factors hindering strong voter turnout such as the requirement of physical presence during limited hours at polling stations. However, this vision brings transparency and confidentiality requirements that render the design of such solutions challenging. Specifically, the counting implementation must support reproducibility, and the choice of individual voters must remain confidential. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel referendum protocol that ensures transparency, confidentiality, and integrity, in trustless networks. The protocol is built by combining secure multi-party computation and distributed ledger technology, e.g., a Blockchain. The persistence and immutability of the protocol communication allow verifiability of the referendum outcome by any participant. Voters therefore do not need to trust third parties.

Voting methods have evolved from paper ballot systems to e-voting systems to preserve the integrity of votes, ensuring a secure, transparent, and verifiable process. Continuous efforts have been made to develop a secure e-voting system that eliminates fraud attempts and provides accurate voting results. In this paper, we propose the architecture of a blockchain-based e-voting system called VoteChain. Developed to support the existing voting system in the state of Palestine, VoteChain aims to provide secure e-voting with features such as auditability, verifiability, accuracy, privacy, flexibility, transparency, mobility, availability, convenience, data integrity, and distribution of authority. The work introduces a smart contract designed to meet the demands of e-voting, governing transactions, monitoring computations, enforcing acceptable usage policies, and managing data usage after transmission. The proposed system also adopts advanced cryptographic techniques to enhance security. VoteChain features a web-based interface to facilitate user interaction, providing protection against multiple or double voting to ensure the integrity of the election. Furthermore, VoteChain is designed with a user-friendly and easily accessible administrator interface for managing voters, constituencies, and candidates. It ensures equal participation rights for all voters, fostering fair and healthy competition among candidates while preserving voter anonymity.

When considering e-voting, the significance of blockchain technology in boosting the security, transparency, and integrity of the entire process is evident. This ranges from the initial steps of user registration and authentication to the final stages of voting and result validation. Unlike conventional voting systems, which are plagued by issues such as fraud, tampering, and a lack of transparency in the result tallying and viewing processes, not to mention the delays, blockchain-enabled e-voting mitigates these challenges within government frameworks. It ensures a secure, tamper-proof, and transparent procedure, where each vote is recorded as an immutable transaction, thereby enhancing the process’s reliability. This paper explores the integration of voice recognition and fingerprinting using blockchain technology for enhancing the security of e-voting systems, comparing alternative authentication methods, and emphasizing the need for a multi-modal approach to achieve better security and reliability of the voting systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'language': 'english', 'url': 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85214504660&doi=10.1109%2FBCCA62388.2024.10844450&partnerID=40&md5=5e95428e4f4afc9f4e8c3c36f383b019', 'doc_type': None, 'source': 'scopus', 'source_id': '2-s2.0-85214504660', 'query_topic': 'scopus_ui_manual', 'query_string': 'TITLE-ABS-KEY(("electoral integrity" OR "e-voting" OR "electronic voting" OR "ballot auditability" OR "voting trust") AND ("VVPAT" OR "end-to-end verifiability" OR "risk-limiting audit" OR "cryptographic" OR "blockchain") AND (evaluation OR "empirical study" OR "comparative analysis")) AND PUBYEAR > 1989 AND LANGUAGE(english)', 'retrieved_at': '2025-11-03T15:54:10Z', 'id': 'doi:10.1109/bcca62388.2024.10844450', '_stable_id': 'doi:10.1109/bcca62388.2024.10844450'} is not of type 'array'

Electronic voting has had limited success worldwide, largely due to security and manipulation concerns. The COVID-19 pandemic has reignited interest in remote e-voting for safe participation while social distancing, though security remains a critical issue. Embracing electronic voting is essential to safeguard rights, improve resource efficiency, and promote digital citizenship. Accordingly, to address security concerns in e-voting, this research emphasizes the importance of security and legal measures. The study is based on ISO15408 (Common Criteria) certification process, a framework for independent security evaluations. The paper proposes a methodology that combines legal and technical requirements for e-voting security assessments, focusing on BPMN processes to model scenarios. The methodology has been applied to a common Ethereum smart contract, focusing on the e-voting process. A detailed analysis of a Solidity e-voting smart contract reveals its vulnerabilities and limitations. The research also produces a BPMN representation of an e-voting scenario, aligning logical behaviour with smart contract implementation.

BBs are widely used within many security protocols, including secure multiparty computation protocols, evoting systems, and electronic auctions. Even though the security of protocols crucially depends on the underlying BB, as also highlighted by recent works, the literature on constructing secure BBs is sparse. The so-far only provably secure BBs requiretrusted components and sometimes also networks without message loss, which makes them unsuitable for applications with particularly high security needs where these assumptions might not always be met. In this work, we fill this gap by leveraging the concepts of accountability and universal composability (UC). More specifically, we propose the first ideal functionality for accountable BBs that formalizes the security requirements of such BBs in UC. We then propose Fabric∗<inf>BB</inf> as a slight extension designed on top of Fabric*, which is a variant of the prominent Hyperledger Fabric distributed ledger protocol, and show that Fabric∗<inf>BB</inf> UC-realizes our ideal BB functionality. This result makes Fabric∗<inf>BB</inf> the first provably accountable BB, an often desired, but so far not formally proven property for BBs, and also the first BB that has been proven to be secure based only on standard cryptographic assumptions and without requiring trusted BB components or network assumptions.

Blockchain technology emerges as a beacon of hope in addressing these significant shortcomings, By harnessing the power of decentralization, blockchain offers the potential to revolutionize the election process, substantially reducing the risks associated with manipulation and fraud. Blockchain-based e-voting solutions, characterized by their decentralized architecture, cryptographic security measures, and unparalleled transparency, employ smart contracts to further fortify the pillars of security and fairness in elections. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge and tackle the challenges that lie ahead. Issues like preserving voter privacy and achieving scalability in blockchain-based e-voting systems must be addressed head-on. While the application of blockchain extends far beyond voting, resolving scalability concerns and navigating resistance from established power structures will be instrumental in realizing widespread adoption. In conclusion, the mounting distrust in traditional voting systems, coupled with the limitations of digital alternatives, underscores the pressing need to explore blockchain technology as a means of enhancing electronic voting. By doing so, We can create the conditions for a safer and equitable democratic process that safeguards the fundamental rights of voters. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'language': 'english', 'url': 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192978562&doi=10.1109%2FASSIC60049.2024.10507924&partnerID=40&md5=8b19a9e561ec8a0b4b59dcde442e27b6', 'doc_type': None, 'source': 'scopus', 'source_id': '2-s2.0-85192978562', 'query_topic': 'scopus_ui_manual', 'query_string': 'TITLE-ABS-KEY(("electoral integrity" OR "e-voting" OR "electronic voting" OR "ballot auditability" OR "voting trust") AND ("VVPAT" OR "end-to-end verifiability" OR "risk-limiting audit" OR "cryptographic" OR "blockchain") AND (evaluation OR "empirical study" OR "comparative analysis")) AND PUBYEAR > 1989 AND LANGUAGE(english)', 'retrieved_at': '2025-11-03T15:54:10Z', 'id': 'doi:10.1109/assic60049.2024.10507924', '_stable_id': 'doi:10.1109/assic60049.2024.10507924'} is not of type 'array'

Electronic voting technology can speed up ballot counting and provide accessibility for voters with disabilities. Electronic voting can also facilitate electoral fraud, especially given the risks associated with remote voting. Building a secure electronic voting system that offers the fairness and privacy of current voting schemes, while providing the transparency and flexibility offered by electronic systems has been a challenge for a long time. In this work-in-progress paper, we evaluate an application of blockchain as a service to implement distributed electronic voting systems. The paper proposes a novel electronic voting system based on blockchain that addresses some of the limitations in existing systems and evaluates some of the popular blockchain frameworks for the purpose of constructing a blockchain-based e-voting system. In particular, we evaluate the potential of distributed ledger technologies through the description of a case study; namely, the process of an election, and the implementation of a blockchainbased application, which improves the security and decreases the cost of hosting a nationwide election. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'language': 'english', 'url': 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186709242&doi=10.1201%2F9781003393580-106&partnerID=40&md5=799a90d5b6ebb53dbb4b132df25f56c9', 'doc_type': None, 'source': 'scopus', 'source_id': '2-s2.0-85186709242', 'query_topic': 'scopus_ui_manual', 'query_string': 'TITLE-ABS-KEY(("electoral integrity" OR "e-voting" OR "electronic voting" OR "ballot auditability" OR "voting trust") AND ("VVPAT" OR "end-to-end verifiability" OR "risk-limiting audit" OR "cryptographic" OR "blockchain") AND (evaluation OR "empirical study" OR "comparative analysis")) AND PUBYEAR > 1989 AND LANGUAGE(english)', 'retrieved_at': '2025-11-03T15:54:10Z', 'id': 'doi:10.1201/9781003393580-106', '_stable_id': 'doi:10.1201/9781003393580-106'} is not of type 'array'

However, the identity privacy of voters may not be effectively protected during the counting process of third-party electronic voting. In order to solve the problems of transparency and identity privacy protection in electronic voting, this paper combines pseudonym mechanism and digital signature technology to propose a privacy protection scheme for double signature electronic voting based on Consortium blockchain. By introducing the Consortium Blockchain, the voting ciphertext is published on the Blockchain to realize the transparency of electronic voting and ensure the security of the voting; the introduction of the pseudonym mechanism can effectively protect the identity privacy of voters; the use of homomorphic encryption technology to realize ciphertext vote counting, it can effectively resist the internal attack of electronic voting; through double signature, that is, to sign the voting ciphertext and pseudonym to ensure the identity of the voter and the legitimacy of the vote. At the same time, a scoring mechanism is introduced to achieve more precise evaluation of candidates by voters, and the Bulletproof protocol is used to standardize the range of score. The electronic voting privacy protection scheme proposed in this paper can also satisfy multi-candidate voting and is applicable to various voting scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'language': 'english', 'url': 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185713986&doi=10.1007%2F978-981-99-9785-5_38&partnerID=40&md5=cd027944c16659d4484c12fc37ef976a', 'doc_type': None, 'source': 'scopus', 'source_id': '2-s2.0-85185713986', 'query_topic': 'scopus_ui_manual', 'query_string': 'TITLE-ABS-KEY(("electoral integrity" OR "e-voting" OR "electronic voting" OR "ballot auditability" OR "voting trust") AND ("VVPAT" OR "end-to-end verifiability" OR "risk-limiting audit" OR "cryptographic" OR "blockchain") AND (evaluation OR "empirical study" OR "comparative analysis")) AND PUBYEAR > 1989 AND LANGUAGE(english)', 'retrieved_at': '2025-11-03T15:54:10Z', 'id': 'doi:10.1007/978-981-99-9785-5_38', '_stable_id': 'doi:10.1007/978-981-99-9785-5_38'} is not of type 'array'

We comparatively studied how a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), Aave project community, and a centralized autonomous organization (CAO), GitHub project community, managed external crises caused by conflicts. Our mixed-method analysis showed that a DAO could be better than a CAO for mitigating conflicts. And blockchain technologies (i.e., voting and cryptocurrency) played vital roles.
