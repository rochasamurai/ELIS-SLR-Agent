However, achieving coercion resistance while simultaneously guaranteeing election verifiability and scalability remains a significant challenge in electronic voting systems. In response to these challenges, we propose LOKI Vote, a blockchain-based e-voting protocol designed to ensure strong coercion resistance while guaranteeing all the requirements of a secure and democratic election. LOKI Vote employs advanced cryptographic mechanisms, including Zero-Knowledge Proofs, the Modified El-Gamal Cryptosystem, and BBS Group Signatures. It integrates the LLARP mix network, providing anonymous, low-latency communication between voters and election authorities. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures immutability and public verifiability, allowing anyone to audit the process without compromising voter anonymity. Additionally, we conduct an informal security assessment against a list of security requirements including voters’ eligibility, fairness, verifiability and data integrity. We then formally verify the protocol’s security using ProVerif and Applied Pi-Calculus, demonstrating that it guarantees ballot secrecy, voter authentication, and vote privacy. We implement our proposed approach and evaluate its performance in terms of execution time, cost, and scalability. The results show the protocol’s efficiency. Finally, we simulate a real-world election using LOKI Vote to validate its practicality. Our findings demonstrate that it scales efficiently to millions of voters, significantly reducing vote tallying time. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Blockchain technology; Coercion-resistance; Group signature; Performance and security evaluation; Practical implementation; Zero-knowledge proofs,,,Springer,26618907; 2662995X,,,English,SN COMPUT.

Nevertheless, concerns about the disclosure of sensitive information and the potential compromise of voter privacy might be raised by the transparency of Blockchain (BC)-centric systems. For overcoming these challenges, an Efficient E-Voting System with a QR Code using Blockchain (EVS-QCB) is proposed in this research. To strike a balance between transparency and privacy, the proposed approach incorporates an authority management mechanism. The proposed E-Voting system includes a QR code-based multi-factor authentication mechanism, unlike conventional single-factor authentication system, reducing the risk of credential theft. The system begins with the Voter Registration Phase, where the voters register to the E-Voting system. For selecting relevant attributes from voter details, the system uses a Linear Scaling-based Fox Hunting Optimization Algorithm (LS-FHOA). Next, QR codes and smart contracts are generated and stored in a secure database. Voters authenticate through usernames, passwords, and QR codes during the voting phase, and the system ensures eligibility and prevents duplicate voting utilizing Smart Contracts. Using the Public key raised to the Power of Private key-Elliptic Curve Cryptography (P3-ECC) algorithm, the voting details are encrypted. Utilizing the Exponential Fast Fourier Transformation- Single-Window Iterative Fast Fourier Transform (EFFT-SWIFFT) hashing technique, the encrypted data is transformed into a unique hash code. The generated hash codes are securely stored in BC technology. During the vote counting time, the voting details are fetched from the BC and processed for determining the final results. Performance evaluations demonstrate superior execution time, security, and memory usage compared to baseline models.

With the ongoing evolution of communication technology and the Internet of Things, the importance of electronic voting protocols is anticipated to experience a significant rise in the advancement of smart cities. Leveraging the blockchain's tamper-resistant and publicly verifiable properties, along with the concept of enabling all participants to tally election results, blockchain-based self-tallying voting protocols effectively address the shortcomings of centralized traditional electronic voting. However, existing voting protocols still face the dual challenge of security and efficiency. The primary issues include the difficulty in ensuring voter anonymity and election fairness, as well as the insufficient system robustness and low tallying efficiency resulting from security design. To tackle these concerns, we propose a novel approach to constructing efficient and flexible voting protocols that concurrently ensure fairness and anonymity. Specifically, we encapsulate the decryption private keys corresponding to the public keys of encrypted ballots in time capsules to safeguard voting fairness. Additionally, based on our proposed approach, we construct an efficient and flexible score voting protocol for smart cities. The protocol employs traceable ring signature to protect the voter anonymity and public traceability, utilizes a dual-key additive homomorphic ElGamal encryption to encapsulate ballots. We also improve signature-based set membership proofs to verify the validity of ballots. Furthermore, through security analysis and performance evaluation, we demonstrate that our proposed protocol meets all security objectives with reasonable costs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Anonymity; blockchain; fairness; self-tallying; voting,Authentication Protocol; Blockchain; Electronic voting; Smart city; Voting machines; Block-chain; Communicationtechnology; Electronic voting protocols; Fairness; Property; Publicly verifiable; Self-tallying; Tamper-resistant; Voting; Voting protocols; Anonymity,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,23274662,9781728176055,,English,IEEE Internet Things J.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207291990

Recently, researchers have shown significant interest in how blockchain technology could improve the voting process. However, despite its potential, blockchain remains complex, and setting it up, even for a small-scale election, can be challenging. This paper proposes a lightweight blockchain-based e-voting framework with reduced computational overhead, making it more practical for small-scale elections. The objective of the framework is to enhance voter trust in the e-voting process. The framework was designed following a comprehensive comparative analysis of zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) and consensus algorithms. A mock election was conducted to validate the proposed framework.

As digital voting systems are increasingly being investigated worldwide, ensuring the integrity of the process using robust security measures is of great importance. This paper presents a simplified model to enhance electoral integrity by leveraging Blockchain technology in the context of Oman’s digital voting system. The model uses Blockchain technology to create a secure and trustworthy voting environment, addressing key vulnerabilities in digital electoral systems. Methods: The research utilized a quantitative approach, employing an experimental design methodology using open-source software to simulate voting systems. Synthetic population data is used to operate these systems, while advanced biometric authentication technologies verify voter identities. Blockchain technology is leveraged to ensure secure vote recording, with smart contracts used to authenticate voters and securely record votes. Additionally, synchronous transactions are executed for both voter registration and voting processes, enhancing the overall security and efficiency of the system. Results: The experimental results show that Blockchain enhances electoral integrity and security in Oman’s voting system, improving elections’ transparency and reliability. The performance evaluation of the model focuses on efficiency, reliability, and scalability metrics. Asynchronous transactions are utilized to improve processing time for voter registration and voting. Election administrators can manage, monitor, and certify election results, while Ethereum nodes ensure decentralized verification and transparency in the voting process. Conclusion: This research offers insights for policymakers to consider Blockchain for electoral reforms, addressing issues like data integrity, fraud prevention, and transparency to boost voter trust. A strong regulatory framework and public awareness are crucial for successful implementation. Pilot projects are needed to assess Blockchain’s practical impact. Oman could lead global innovation in electoral technology, though infrastructure and public resistance challenges must be managed. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Blockchain Technology; Decentralized voting; Digital Voting Systems; Electoral Integrity; Oman; Secure Voter Authentication; Transparent Elections; Voter Security,"administrative personnel; algorithm; Article; artificial intelligence; asynchronous transaction; awareness; benchmarking; biometry; blockchain; blockchain enhanced electoral integrity; conceptual framework; controlled study; data integrity; decision making; democracy; democratic system; digital transparency; disinformation; election; electoral legitimacy; experimental design; fraud; health care system; human; information processing; infrastructure; internet literacy; interpersonal conflict; machine learning; named groups by occupation; Oman; peer review; perception; quantitative analysis; rapid prototyping; reliability; secure digital voting system; simulation; Smart Contract Developer; social media; synchronous transaction; technology; trust; trustworthiness; voter registration; voting; vulnerability; web application; computer security; politics; theoretical model; Blockchain; Computer Security; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Politics; Voting",,F1000 Research Ltd,20461402,,,English,F1000 Res.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105015134345

However, modern democracies face mounting pressure to balance transparency, security, and environmental stewardship in their electoral processes. Conventional paper-based voting systems present significant challenges: substantial ecological footprints through deforestation and CO2 emissions, vulnerability to fraud and human error, and inherent scalability limitations that strain electoral infrastructure. We present PQR-HAC, a novel hybrid blockchain e-voting architecture that addresses these critical deficiencies through advanced sharding mechanisms and post-quantum cryptographic protocols. Our system employs geographically distributed blockchain shards that reduce transaction latency by 40% while supporting large-scale electoral operations. A custom multiparty computation (MPC) protocol generates anonymized voter tokens, effectively preventing coercion and duplicate voting while preserving voter privacy integrity. Performance evaluation using real-world election datasets demonstrates that PQR-HAC achieves 3.2times higher transaction throughput compared to existing blockchain voting implementations, establishing its feasibility for national-scale deployment. This framework represents a significant advancement in democratic modernization, offering integrated security assurances, environmental sustainability, and mathematically verifiable trust mechanisms that address the evolving needs of contemporary electoral systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Blockchain; E-voting; Multi-party computation; Post-quantum cryptography; Sharding,Data privacy; Electronic voting; Network security; Public policy; Quantum cryptography; Voting machines; Block-chain; CO2 emissions; E-Voting; E-voting systems; Ecological footprint; Environmental stewardship; Multiparty computation; Post quantum cryptography; Sharding; Voting systems; Blockchain,,Springer,09756809; 09764348,,,English,Intl.

This paper presents an Android-based blockchain-powered e-voting system that ensures a secure, verifiable, and tamper-resistant electoral process. The system integrates Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts, and an Android interface to enable a decentralized voting mechanism. Experimental evaluation was conducted using Ganache for local blockchain simulation and Truffle for smart contract deployment. Performance testing with 10 sample voters across four political parties (DMK, ADMK, BJP, NTK) demonstrated instantaneous vote registration, with an average processing time of less than 1 millisecond. The system ensures immutability, as each vote is recorded with a unique transaction hash, preventing unauthorized alterations. Additionally, gas consumption per vote was measured between 21,000 - 30,000 gas units, ensuring cost efficiency. By leveraging blockchain's decentralized structure and cryptographic security, the proposed system eliminates vote manipulation risks and enhances voter anonymity. The results indicate that this system is a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional e-voting methods, providing real-time vote tracking and verifiable election outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Candidate information; Election Committee module; Election updates; Electoral process management; Ethereum blockchain; Ganache Truffle; Personal details registration; Smart contracts; User module,Android (operating system); Cryptography; Electronic voting; Ethereum; Mobile security; Smart contract; Voting machines; Block-chain; Candidate information; Election committee module; Election update; Electoral process management; Ethereum blockchain; Ganache truffle; Personal detail registration; Process management; User module; Blockchain,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9798331522438,,English,"Proc.

The sheer scale of nodes inherent in distributed environments necessitates minimizing communication overhead per node while ensuring protocol availability, particularly under adversarial conditions. Existing solutions have managed to reduce the optimistic overhead to a minimum of O(n2), where n represents the node count of the system. In this paper, we step further by proposing and implementing RandFlash, a leaderless random beacon protocol that achieves an optimistic communication complexity of O(n log n). Evaluation results demonstrate that RandFlash outperforms existing constructions, RandPiper (CCS'21) and OptRand (NDSS'23), in terms of the number of random beacons generated within large-scale networks comprising 64 nodes or more (e.g., in sizes of 80 and 128). Furthermore, RandFlash exhibits resilience, capable of withstanding up to one-third of the nodes acting maliciously, all without the need for strongly trusted setups (i.e., embedding a secret trapdoor by trusted third parties). We also provide formal security proofs validating all properties upheld by this lineage. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",blockchain; Distributed randomness beacon; publicly verifiable secret sharing; sub-quadratic complexity,Block-chain; Breakings; Distributed randomness beacon; Distributed systems; Electronic voting; Large-scales; Optimistics; Publicly verifiable secret sharing; Quadratic complexity; Sub-quadratic complexity,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,15566013,,,English,IEEE Trans.

Our publicly available implementation uses the zk-SNARK protocol, a form of ZKP, to securely verify voter eligibility across both local and national elections. To contextualize our contribution, we conducted a comparative analysis against comparable solutions. This comparison focused on gas costs associated with blockchain operations and the range of supported functionalities. Our system stands out by incorporating a “voting sandbox” feature, which features the ability for a user to prove eligibility for the vote session, through different criteria, while also maintaining anonymity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Blockchain; E-voting; Zero-knowledge proof,Block-chain; Comparative analyzes; Contextualize; E-Voting; E-voting systems; Electronic voting; Gas cost; National elections; Voting systems; Zero-knowledge proofs,"Ciurea, C.; Pocatilu, P.; Filip, F.",Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,21903026; 21903018,9789819617494; 9789819634194; 9789819647170; 9789819612055; 9789819652488; 9783642173868; 9789811549168; 9789813341821; 9783030756796; 9783031044342,,English,Smart Innov.

This setup must be transparent to maintain the integrity of the election. A crucial aspect of this trusted setup involves generating group generators for a finite cyclic group, which are then used in cryptographic algorithms deployed within the voting system. Although computing group generators is generally not considered a difficult problem, election verifiability – where every step can be ascertained by independent third parties – excludes many of them, as they fail to provide verifiable evidence of correctness. In this work, we present a formally verified implementation of the group generator algorithm A.2.3 and the group generator verification algorithm A.2.4, specified in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), FIPS 186-4, in the Coq theorem prover. These two algorithms are highly sought-after methods to compute and verify group generator(s), respectively, because their outcomes can be established independently by third parties. Our formalisation captures all the requirements specified in algorithms A.2.3 and A.2.4 using the expressive type system of the Coq theorem prover. We evaluate the group generator algorithm within the Coq theorem prover itself to produce group generators, thereby only trusting the Coq theorem prover and its evaluation mechanism. In fact, our implementation is so efficient that it can compute the group generators used in real-world democratic elections in 30 min on a M3 laptop. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Coq Theorem Prover; Cryptography; E-Voting; Fermat’s Little Theorem; Formal Verification; Safe Computation; SHA-256; Verifiable Group Generator,Asynchronous generators; Computation theory; Consensus algorithm; Cryptography; Electronic voting; Encryption algorithms; Voting machines; Coq theorem prover; E-Voting; Fermat’s little theorem; Finite cyclic groups; Safe computation; SHA-256; Theorem provers; Third parties; Verifiable group generator; Formal verification,"Hojjat, H.; Caltais, G.",Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,16113349; 03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141; 9783031984136,,English,Lect.

However, current systems face significant challenges related to robustness, fault tolerance, and efficient communication management. This paper introduces SRFACS (Secure and Robust Framework for Anonymous Communication Systems), designed to address these issues by integrating advanced cryptographic techniques with a structured communication framework. Traditional anonymous communication systems usually lack sufficient fault tolerance, making them vulnerable to node failures, especially in asynchronous environments. In order to overcome these limitations and ensure that the system can keep running in the event of node failure (especially in an asynchronous environment), SRFACS integrates an improved asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (ABFT) protocol. We use this protocol to expand the traditional single communication node into a structured node group, and handle up to (n − 1)/3 faulty nodes in these groups, so as to enhance fault tolerance and maintain continuous operation. To efficiently manage inter-group communication, SRFACS utilizes leader nodes to coordinate and streamline the communication processes. To mitigate the risks associated with leader failures, we have implemented an efficient leader change protocol that promptly replaces defective leaders, ensuring uninterrupted system performance. Additionally, to prevent erroneous leader actions from compromising the system, we have introduced an advanced multi-signature scheme. This approach secures communication by requiring multiple signatures for verification processes. Furthermore, we have implemented a reputation incentive mechanism to encourage nodes to maintain optimal performance and avoid malicious behavior. This mechanism evaluates nodes according to their past activities and reliability to achieve dynamic updates of SRFACS node groups. We have conducted rigorous security analyses and component performance evaluations of SRFACS, further confirming its potential as a promising secure communication solution. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,accuracy; algorithm; anticoagulant therapy; Article; artificial neural network; asynchronous byzantine fault tolerant; classification algorithm; conceptual framework; decision making; design; human; interpersonal communication; learning algorithm; mathematical parameters; open access publishing; P wave; protocol; reliability; running; secure and robust framework for anonymous communication system; theoretical model; voting; computer network; computer security; Algorithms; Communication; Computer Communication Networks; Computer Security; Humans,,Public Library of Science,19326203,,POLNC,English,PLoS ONE,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85210722400

Secure electronic voting is a vision for the future of elections and referendums. Such a system can counteract factors hindering strong voter turnout such as the requirement of physical presence during limited hours at polling stations. However, this vision brings transparency and confidentiality requirements that render the design of such solutions challenging. Specifically, the counting implementation must support reproducibility, and the choice of individual voters must remain confidential. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel referendum protocol that ensures transparency, confidentiality, and integrity, in trustless networks. The protocol is built by combining secure multi-party computation and distributed ledger technology, e.g., a Blockchain. The persistence and immutability of the protocol communication allow verifiability of the referendum outcome by any participant. Voters therefore do not need to trust third parties.

Voting methods have evolved from paper ballot systems to e-voting systems to preserve the integrity of votes, ensuring a secure, transparent, and verifiable process. Continuous efforts have been made to develop a secure e-voting system that eliminates fraud attempts and provides accurate voting results. In this paper, we propose the architecture of a blockchain-based e-voting system called VoteChain. Developed to support the existing voting system in the state of Palestine, VoteChain aims to provide secure e-voting with features such as auditability, verifiability, accuracy, privacy, flexibility, transparency, mobility, availability, convenience, data integrity, and distribution of authority. The work introduces a smart contract designed to meet the demands of e-voting, governing transactions, monitoring computations, enforcing acceptable usage policies, and managing data usage after transmission. The proposed system also adopts advanced cryptographic techniques to enhance security. VoteChain features a web-based interface to facilitate user interaction, providing protection against multiple or double voting to ensure the integrity of the election. Furthermore, VoteChain is designed with a user-friendly and easily accessible administrator interface for managing voters, constituencies, and candidates. It ensures equal participation rights for all voters, fostering fair and healthy competition among candidates while preserving voter anonymity. A comparative analysis demonstrates VoteChain’s advancements in privacy, security, and scalability over both traditional and blockchain-based e-voting systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",blockchain; e-voting; smart contracts; voter fraud prevention,Blockchain; Electronic voting; Voting machines; Block-chain; Decision-making process; E-Voting; E-voting systems; Fraud prevention; Palestine; Voter fraud prevention; Voting method; Voting results; Voting systems; Anonymity,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),19995903,,,English,Future Internet,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85210587081

To address such issues, this work presents a decentralized voting system based on blockchain technology, Fully Homomorphic Encryption, tokenization, and Proof-of-Stake mechanisms to promote the system's sustainability while enhancing voting privacy and anonymization. Our solution introduces verifiability to voting processes without any trusted intermediaries. We use the inter-organizational collaboration use case since it introduces additional voting requirements in the private domain, such as promoting cooperative behavioral processes to develop trustworthy relationships between organizations.

The load testing was conducted to observe the system's throughput, speedup, and efficiency under two scenarios: with and without a load balancer, as implementing a blockchain-based e-voting might be partially decentralized with government intervention in certain parts of the process.

When considering e-voting, the significance of blockchain technology in boosting the security, transparency, and integrity of the entire process is evident. This ranges from the initial steps of user registration and authentication to the final stages of voting and result validation. Unlike conventional voting systems, which are plagued by issues such as fraud, tampering, and a lack of transparency in the result tallying and viewing processes, not to mention the delays, blockchain-enabled e-voting mitigates these challenges within government frameworks. It ensures a secure, tamper-proof, and transparent procedure, where each vote is recorded as an immutable transaction, thereby enhancing the process’s reliability.

Electronic voting has had limited success worldwide, largely due to security and manipulation concerns. The COVID-19 pandemic has reignited interest in remote e-voting for safe participation while social distancing, though security remains a critical issue. Embracing electronic voting is essential to safeguard rights, improve resource efficiency, and promote digital citizenship. Accordingly, to address security concerns in e-voting, this research emphasizes the importance of security and legal measures. The study is based on ISO15408 (Common Criteria) certification process, a framework for independent security evaluations. The paper proposes a methodology that combines legal and technical requirements for e-voting security assessments, focusing on BPMN processes to model scenarios. The methodology has been applied to a common Ethereum smart contract, focusing on the e-voting process. A detailed analysis of a Solidity e-voting smart contract reveals its vulnerabilities and limitations. The research also produces a BPMN representation of an e-voting scenario, aligning logical behaviour with smart contract implementation.

Even though the security of protocols crucially depends on the underlying BB, as also highlighted by recent works, the literature on constructing secure BBs is sparse. The so-far only provably secure BBs requiretrusted components and sometimes also networks without message loss, which makes them unsuitable for applications with particularly high security needs where these assumptions might not always be met. In this work, we fill this gap by leveraging the concepts of accountability and universal composability (UC). More specifically, we propose the first ideal functionality for accountable BBs that formalizes the security requirements of such BBs in UC. We then propose Fabric∗<inf>BB</inf> as a slight extension designed on top of Fabric*, which is a variant of the prominent Hyperledger Fabric distributed ledger protocol, and show that Fabric∗<inf>BB</inf> UC-realizes our ideal BB functionality. This result makes Fabric∗<inf>BB</inf> the first provably accountable BB, an often desired, but so far not formally proven property for BBs, and also the first BB that has been proven to be secure based only on standard cryptographic assumptions and without requiring trusted BB components or network assumptions. Through an implementation and performance evaluation we show that Fabric∗<inf>BB</inf> is practical for many applications of BBs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Accountability; Blockchain; Bulletin Board; Distributed Ledger; E-voting; Foundations; Hyperledger Fabric; Ideal Bulletin Board Functionality; Universal Composability,Blockchain; Cryptography; Distributed ledger; Electronic voting; Mendelevium; Accountability; Block-chain; Building blockes; CryptoGraphics; E-Voting; Hyperledger fabric; Ideal bulletin board functionality; Provably secure; Secure implementation; Universal composability; Bulletin boards,,IEEE Computer Society,19401434,9781728176079; 9781538666807; 9781728165721; 9781538632161; 9781509026074; 9798350362039; 0769528198; 9780769528199; 9780769531823; 0818679905,,English,Proc.IEEE Comput.

By providing a public verification key and accompanying proof with the output, all parties can verify the correctness of the output without interaction. VRF has gained widespread adoption in blockchain applications, including Algorand, Ouroboros, and ChainLink. This article introduces SM2VRF, the first VRF based on the Chinese standard SM2 cryptographic algorithm, and extends it to a batch construction called SM2VRF-B for efficient verification of multiple sources. We showcase the applicability of SM2VRF in an electronic random committee election scenario, where the blockchain is utilized for storing candidate parameters and votes. By employing the Hamming distance, our scheme eliminates the risk of election failure. We provide a security proof for the proposed scheme, followed by an evaluation of the performance of both SM2VRF and SM2VRF-B.

Blockchain technology emerges as a beacon of hope in addressing these significant shortcomings, By harnessing the power of decentralization, blockchain offers the potential to revolutionize the election process, substantially reducing the risks associated with manipulation and fraud. Blockchain-based e-voting solutions, characterized by their decentralized architecture, cryptographic security measures, and unparalleled transparency, employ smart contracts to further fortify the pillars of security and fairness in elections. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge and tackle the challenges that lie ahead. Issues like preserving voter privacy and achieving scalability in blockchain-based e-voting systems must be addressed head-on. While the application of blockchain extends far beyond voting, resolving scalability concerns and navigating resistance from established power structures will be instrumental in realizing widespread adoption. In conclusion, the mounting distrust in traditional voting systems, coupled with the limitations of digital alternatives, underscores the pressing need to explore blockchain technology as a means of enhancing electronic voting.

Electronic voting technology can speed up ballot counting and provide accessibility for voters with disabilities. Electronic voting can also facilitate electoral fraud, especially given the risks associated with remote voting. Building a secure electronic voting system that offers the fairness and privacy of current voting schemes, while providing the transparency and flexibility offered by electronic systems has been a challenge for a long time. In this work-in-progress paper, we evaluate an application of blockchain as a service to implement distributed electronic voting systems. The paper proposes a novel electronic voting system based on blockchain that addresses some of the limitations in existing systems and evaluates some of the popular blockchain frameworks for the purpose of constructing a blockchain-based e-voting system.

However, the identity privacy of voters may not be effectively protected during the counting process of third-party electronic voting. In order to solve the problems of transparency and identity privacy protection in electronic voting, this paper combines pseudonym mechanism and digital signature technology to propose a privacy protection scheme for double signature electronic voting based on Consortium blockchain. By introducing the Consortium Blockchain, the voting ciphertext is published on the Blockchain to realize the transparency of electronic voting and ensure the security of the voting; the introduction of the pseudonym mechanism can effectively protect the identity privacy of voters; the use of homomorphic encryption technology to realize ciphertext vote counting, it can effectively resist the internal attack of electronic voting; through double signature, that is, to sign the voting ciphertext and pseudonym to ensure the identity of the voter and the legitimacy of the vote. At the same time, a scoring mechanism is introduced to achieve more precise evaluation of candidates by voters, and the Bulletproof protocol is used to standardize the range of score. The electronic voting privacy protection scheme proposed in this paper can also satisfy multi-candidate voting and is applicable to various voting scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",ECDSA; Electronic voting; Hyperledger Fabric; Paillier encryption,Blockchain; Distributed ledger; Electronic voting; Transparency; Voting machines; Block-chain; Ciphertexts; Counting process; ECDSA; Hyperledg fabric; Paillier encryption; Privacy protection; Protection schemes; Third parties; Cryptography,"Vaidya, J.; Gabbouj, M.; Li, J.",Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,16113349; 03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141; 9783031984136,,English,Lect.

We recently witnessed the first de facto blockchain takeover that happened between Steem and TRON. Within one hour of this incident, TRON founder took over the entire Steem committee, forcing the original Steem community to leave the blockchain that they maintained for years. This is a historical event in the evolution of blockchains and Web 3.0. Despite its significant disruptive impact, little is known about how vulnerable DPoS blockchains are in general to takeovers and the ways in which we can improve their resistance to takeovers. In this paper, we demonstrate that the resistance of a DPoS blockchain to takeovers is governed by both the theoretical design and the actual use of its underlying coin-based voting governance system. When voters actively cooperate to resist potential takeovers, our theoretical analysis reveals that the current active resistance of DPoS blockchains is far below the theoretical upper bound. However in practice, voter preferences could be significantly different. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of the passive takeover resistance of EOSIO, Steem and TRON. Our study identifies the diversity in voter preferences and characterizes the impact of this diversity on takeover resistance. Through both theoretical and empirical analyses, our study provides novel insights into the security of coin-based voting governance and suggests potential ways to improve the takeover resistance of any blockchain that implements this governance model. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Blockchain; Decentralized Governance; Delegated Proof of Stake; Governance Security; Voting Governance; Web 3.0,Electronic voting; Block-chain; Decentralised; Decentralized governance; Delegated proof of stake; Forcings; Governance security; Theoretical design; Voting governance; Voting systems; Web 3.0; Blockchain,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9798400700507,,English,CCS - Proc.

Attacks and risks to information and internet security are becoming harder to identify. As a result, encryption has been developed as a remedy and is crucial to information security systems. To safeguard the shared data, several strategies are required. In this study, we examined and contrasted the performance of three cryptographic algorithms: DES, 3DES, and AES as applicable to e-voting system. The symmetric encryption techniques mentioned above have been compared. The amount of CPU time, memory, and battery power used by these methods is substantial.

One of the e-voting paradigms, the self-tallying scheme, offers strong protection of the voters' privacy while making the whole voting process verifiable. Decentralized smart contract platforms became interesting practical instantiation of the immutable bulletin board that this scheme requires to preserve its properties. Existing smart contract-based approaches employing the self-tallying scheme (such as OVN or BBB-Voting) are only suitable for a boardroom voting due to their scalability limitation. The goal of our work is to build on existing solutions to achieve scalability without losing privacy guarantees and verifiability. We present SBvote, a blockchain-based self-tallying voting protocol that is scalable in the number of voters, and therefore suitable for large-scale elections. The evaluation of our proof-of-concept implementation shows that the protocol's scalability is limited only by the underlying blockchain platform. We evaluated the scalability of SBvote on two public smart contract platforms - Gnosis and Harmony.

EVMs addressed paper ballot drawbacks but concerns persist over hacking, fraud, software programming, manufacturer affiliations, machine security, and vote storage. An alternative to the prevalent EVM system is a blockchain-based voting system, although it has limitations. The primary objective of this paper is to present the working of traditional, EVM, and blockchain-based voting systems. Finally, the objective is to present a comparison between traditional, EVM, and blockchain-based voting systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",and blockchain; EVM; fraud; hacking; voting,Electronic voting; Personal computing; And blockchain; Block-chain; Comparative analyzes; Electronic voting machines; Fraud; Hacking; System electronics; Voting; Voting process; Voting systems; Blockchain,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9798350335095,,English,"Int.

Electronic voting (E-voting) is becoming more prevalent due to reducing administrative costs and burdens. E-voting systems have many restrictions that affect the electoral process. For example, fraud, tampering with ballot boxes, taking many hours to announce results, and the difficulty of reaching polling stations. Over the last decade, blockchain and smart contract technologies have gained widespread adoption in various sectors, such as cryptocurrencies, finance, banking, and most notably in e-voting systems. If utilized properly, the developer demonstrates properties that are promising for their properties, such as security, privacy, transparency, and decentralization. Moreover, these technologies allow citizens to vote wherever they are via digital technology (computers, smartphones). This paper explains the nature of blockchain and smart contracts and systematically reviews several important e-voting studies.

This systematic literature review examines the methods, constraints, and approaches in the existing literature on blockchain-based electoral vote-counting solutions. A thorough search of pertinent databases was performed, and selected studies were assessed based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The review's findings reveal that most existing solutions employ smart contracts and various cryptographic algorithms to create secure and transparent voting systems. However, the study also pinpoints areas that require improvement, such as scalability, privacy, and accessibility. The review recommends exploring different combinations of blockchain platforms, cryptographic algorithms, and programming languages to develop secure and transparent voting systems. Additionally, future research could investigate the potential benefits and challenges of incorporating Internet of Things (IoT) devices, consensus mechanisms, and other technologies into the voting process.

Identity-based signature were introduced by Shamir in 1984 and gave an alternative to prominent Public Key Infrastructure. An identity-based blind signature (IDBS ) allows any user to interact directly with the signer without any prior interaction with a trusted authority. The first IDBS has been proposed in 2002 and several schemes were proposed since then. Seeking for a full comparison of these primitives, we propose a survey on IDBS and list all such primitives that seems to maintain some security. We also classify their security assumptions based on the existing security expectation that have not been formalized yet in the literature. Moreover, we empirically evaluate the complexity of all the operations used in those schemes with modern cryptographic libraries. This allows us to perform a realistic evaluation of their practical complexities. Hence, we can compare all schemes in terms of complexity and signature size. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Complexity Evaluation; Identity-based Blind Signature; Survey,Network security; Public key cryptography; Blind signatures; Building blockes; Complexity evaluation; CryptoGraphics; Electronic voting; Identity based signature; Identity-based; Identity-based blind signature; Public key infrastructure; Trusted authorities; Authentication,"Jourdan, G.; Mounier, L.; Adams, C.; Sèdes, F.; Garcia-Alfaro, J.",Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,16113349; 03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141; 9783031984136,,English,Lect.

In 2021 Iraq held the Council of Representatives (CoR) elections in 83 electoral constituencies in 19 governorates. Nonetheless, several significant issues arose during this election, including the problem of logistics distribution, the excessively long period of ballot counting, voters can't know if their votes were counted or if their ballots were tampered with, and the inconsistent regulation of vote counting. Blockchain technology, which was just invented, may offer a solution to these problems. This paper introduces an electronic voting system for the Iraq Council of Representatives elections that is based on a prototype of the permission hyperledger fabric blockchain. An immutable, distributed ledger maintained by all members of a network is what blockchain technology is all about. By authenticating each voter, the system can prevent voting fraud by making votes traceable and verifiable, hence decreasing the chance of unlawful activities and fraudulent ballots.

These, such as hyperledger fabric platforms, are sensitive to latency and throughput. In this work, the E-voting case study adopts a hyperledger fabric platform where performance evaluation has been studied in terms of scalability, latency, throughput, CPU usage, and memory allocation. Three scenarios were performed with varying transaction rates, block size, and organizations. Another two scenarios were performed, first with varying block timeout and second, measuring the impact of CPUs and memory allocation on the proposed fabric's entities (peers, orderer, couchDB, chaincode, etc.). The result shows that an increase in block size will significantly affect metrics such as latency and throughput. Good results were obtained with high transaction send rates on large block size. Similarly, low performance is obtained using a small block size with increased send rates. Also, it was noticed that increasing the number of organizations will increase latency and decrease the throughput. Therefore, in applications with a large number of concurrent transactions, to maintain high throughput, block timeouts and block size should be large. On The other hand, the number of CPUs and amount of memory allocation would impact hyperledger fabric performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",blockchain; hyperledger caliper; hyperledger fabric; performance evaluation,,,International Information and Engineering Technology Association,19585748; 0992499X,,,English,Rev.

Specifically, in this study, the connection between the electronic voting system and blockchain nodes is simplified using the REST API design, and the voting opening and counting information is designed to store the latest values in the distributed ledger in JSON format, using a smart contract that cannot be falsified. The developed electronic voting system can provide blockchain authentication, secret voting, forgery prevention, ballot verification, and push notification functions, all of which are currently not supported in existing services. Furthermore, the developed system demonstrates excellence on all evaluation items, including 101 transactions per second (TPS) of blockchain online authentication, 57.6 TPS of secret voting services, 250 TPS of forgery prevention cases, 547 TPS of read transaction processing, and 149 TPS of write transaction processing, along with 100% ballot verification service, secret ballot authentication, and encryption accuracy. Functional and performance verifications were obtained through an external test certification agency in South Korea. Our design allows for blockchain authentication, non-forgery of ballot counting data, and secret voting through blockchain-based distributed ledger technology. In addition, we demonstrate how existing electronic voting systems can be easily converted to blockchain-based electronic voting systems by applying a blockchain-linked REST API. This study greatly contributes to enabling electronic voting using blockchain technology through cost reductions, information restoration, prevention of misrepresentation, and transparency enhancement for a variety of different forms of voting. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",blockchain; electronic voting; online voting; smart contract,Authentication; Blockchain; Cost reduction; Cryptography; Distributed ledger; Electronic voting; Voting machines; Block-chain; Design implementation; Design verification; Evaluation items; ITS applications; Online authentication; Online voting; Transaction processing; Voting systems; Smart contract,,Institute of Electronics Information Communication Engineers,09168532; 17451361,,ITISE,English,IEICE Trans Inf Syst,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137410993

Due to the ability of blockchain to guarantee the integrity of data, it has found wide-range adoption in electronic voting (e-voting) systems in recent years, this is in a bid to prevent manipulation of votes. However, due to the distributed nature of the blockchain, opportunities arise for privacy intrusion of the data being secured. The translation of this privacy flaw in blockchain to e-voting systems is the possibility of violation of the privacy of the electorates. Consequently, in a bid to achieve integrity and privacy of votes in e-voting, this study presents the use of an open-source blockchain system, coupled with a privacy-oriented cryptosystem known as the Paillier cryptosystem, towards addressing the privacy concerns of the blockchain. The performance of the system was evaluated and a transaction throughput of 1424 tps was obtained for ten thousand simulated ballot transactions. Further evaluation was carried out on the system, by increasing the number of system transactions. This showed that the mining time of the blockchain increased by an average factor of 0.18 s for every thousand increases in the number of transactions. Also, the response time of the system to a range of user actions was evaluated over an increasing number of voters. Results obtained showed that the response time of the system for vote casting operations increased by an average of 0.33 min per thousand voters while for vote tallying there was an increase in response time by an average of 0.848 min per thousand voters. The scientific value of this study is the development of an integrity and privacy-preserving e-voting system consisting of an open-source nodechain coupled with a privacy-oriented cryptosystem known as the Paillier cryptosystem following the security requirements of e-voting systems. The proposed system addresses the issue of integrity in e-voting while still maintaining the privacy of the electorates. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",ballot; blockchain; e-voting; homomorphic encryption; proof-of-work,,,Frontiers Media SA,26247852,,,English,Front.

Existing e-voting schemes take advantage of homomorphic encryption to solve the privacy and security issues for {0,1} type e-voting applications. Unfortunately, existing schemes cannot meet the requirements in (real number) score-type e-voting applications, e.g., in competitive competitions or satisfaction surveys. This paper focuses on solving the privacy and security issues for score-type e-voting applications based on cryptographic technology. In order to solve such issues, we propose an electronic scoring scheme based on the CKKS(Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song) homomorphic encryption algorithm. It supports floating-point computing for exploiting homomorphic encryption in scoring and evaluating procedures. In addition, the security analysis demonstrates that the proposal achieves data privacy and security protection. Furthermore, we design an electronic scoring experiment based on the CKKS scheme in the library of SEAL. The experimental results indicate that it only takes 0.42 seconds to complete the scoring evaluation for 5000 people. Finally, the comparison results show that the proposal is more efficient, flexible, and practical. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",data security; electronic voting; homomorphic encryption; privacy preserving,Digital arithmetic; Digital libraries; Electronic voting; Electronic voting scheme; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Homomorphic-encryptions; Privacy and security; Privacy issue; Privacy preserving; Real number; Scoring schemes; Security issues; Privacy-preserving techniques,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781665470674,,English,Int.

The emerging e-voting systems, ranging from standalone electronic voting machines to automated Internet-based systems, aim at promoting better accessibility for disabled voters, faster ballot counting, and voting verifiability. However, the majority of the existing e-voting systems cannot satisfy all the aforementioned properties and are often vulnerable to breaching voters' anonymity. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose Sancus -a blockchain-based electronic voting architecture. Sancus meets the primary criteria of fair voting by providing features, such as voter authentication and anonymity, along with voting reliability and result verifiability. We will discuss Sancus's design and its proof-of-concept implementation in BigchainDB. We will further present its throughput measurements in a small testbed. In the future, we plan to augment Sancus's design and further implementing it on a more prominent blockchain and conduct a large-scale evaluation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Anonymity; blockchain; e-voting; trust,Electronic voting; Voting machines; Anonymity; Block-chain; Design and Development; Electronic voting machines; High costs; Stringents; Trust; Verifiability; Voting systems; Blockchain,"Alsmirat, M.; Aloqaily, M.; Jararweh, Y.; Alsmadi, I.",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781665499583,,English,"Int.

For example, we may vote to choose a proper energy broker in a smart grid system. In this study, we focus on e-voting services in an Internet of energy (IoE) system, which is a new-style smart grid. A practical e-voting in IoE may focus on the properties of fairness, decentralization, eligibility, anonymity, compatibility, verifiability, and coercion resistance. It is difficult to fulfil all these properties simultaneously. Traditional voting schemes often use a public bulletin board or administrator in the voting process, which makes them become centralized. Services that offer e-voting via blockchain can make the voting schemes decentralized. However, many of them ignore the complexity of organizing the data of the transactions, which should be confirmed by the miners. Moreover, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no works have tested the performance in the blockchain while considering practical use cases and constraints. Concerning all the challenges, we propose a practical anonymous voting scheme for IoE called IoEPAV. The proposed scheme fulfils all the mentioned design goals simultaneously. We tested IoEPAV both in different test networks of the Ethereum blockchain to give an overall evaluation. The practical evaluation can show that the proposed scheme is easy to be integrated into a real system like IoE. We also gave a comparison analysis with the state-of-the-art blockchain-based e-voting. All the results show that IoEPAV is decentralized, verifiable, anonymous, and highly efficient. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Blockchain; Electric power transmission networks; Internet of things; Smart power grids; Block-chain; Decentralisation; Decentralised; E-Voting; Energy; Energy systems; Property; Smart grid; Smart grid systems; Voting schemes; Internet of Energy,,Hindawi Limited,19390114; 19390122,,,English,Secur.

Although public blockchains offer transparency and immutability, permissioned consensus is better suited for voting systems' requirements, because an initial level of trust in authorities is always required. Hence, a permissioned Distributed Ledger (DL) immutably storing the voting system's audit trail satisfies demands measurably.ProvotuMN 3.0 is a decentralized and receipt-Free (RF) voting system based on an end-to-end verifiable Re-Encryption Mixnet (RMN). RMNs allow for flexible votes and elections and decouple the ballot structure from the cryptographic voting protocol. Thus, ProvotuMN decentralizes trust (i) through the use of cryptographic shuffles and Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs (NIZKP) in an RMN executed among DL nodes, (ii) by employing a distributed key generation for election keys, and (iii) by offering a decentralized re-encryption service assuring RF.

People have seen their fundamental rights being violated. Other digital voting systems have been challenged due to a lack of transparency. Most voting systems are not transparent enough; this makes it very difficult for the government to gain voters' trust. The reason behind the failure of the traditional and current digital voting system is that it can be easily exploited. The primary objective is to resolve problems of the traditional and digital voting system, which include any kind of mishap or injustice during the process of voting. Blockchain technology can be used in the voting system to have a fair election and reduce injustice. The physical voting systems have many flaws in it as well as the digital voting systems are not perfect enough to be implemented on large scale. This appraises the need for a solution to secure the democratic rights of the people. This article presents a platform based on modern technology blockchain that provides maximum transparency and reliability of the system to build a trustful relationship between voters and election authorities. The proposed platform provides a framework that can be implemented to conduct voting activity digitally through blockchain without involving any physical polling stations. Our proposed framework supports a scalable blockchain, by using flexible consensus algorithms. The Chain Security Algorithm applied in the voting system makes the voting transaction more secure. Smart contracts provide a secure connection between the user and the network while executing a transaction in the chain. The security of the blockchain based voting system has also been discussed. Additionally, encryption of transactions using cryptographic hash and prevention of attack 51% on the blockchain has also been elaborated. Furthermore, the methodology for carrying out blockchain transactions during the process of voting has been elaborated using Blockchain Finally, the performance evaluation of the proposed system shows that the system can be implemented in a large-scale population. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",blockchain; blockchain application; blockchain voting; cryptographic hash; E-polling; E-voting; electoral system; secure voting; voting system,Cryptography; Data privacy; Network security; Peer to peer networks; Transparency; Block-chain; Blockchain application; Blockchain voting; Consensus algorithms; Cryptographic hash; CryptoGraphics; E-polling; E-Voting; Electoral systems; License; Peer-to-peer computing; Privacy; Robustness; Secure voting; Voting systems; Smart contract,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85131711908

In general, the digitization of democratic decision-making is convenient, fast, and cost-saving but can become a gateway for electoral fraud if not properly secured. Authentication and the simultaneous achievement of confidentiality, integrity, and availability represent major challenges toward establishing e-voting as a reliable means of democratic decision-making. In this chapter, a combination of multifactor authentication (MFA) and blockchain techniques is used to secure electronic voting. MFA hampers the compromising of voters’ identities and allows for easy verification, while blockchain technology protects the integrity of the votes and ensures the verifiability of the cast votes. Combining a facial recognition algorithm and RFID authenticates and authorizes voters to participate in the election process. A smart contract implemented on an Ethereum network provides the required measures of integrity and verifiability for secure e-voting. Performance evaluations of the proposed approach show that the MFA yielded a 0.1% false acceptance rate and a 0.8% false rejection rate for 100 voters, respectively. This illustrates that the proposed technique can solve issues of authentication and integrity, thereby paving the way for free, fair, and credible e-democratic decision-making in digitally enabled voting scenarios. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Biometrics; Data communication; Distributed system; Security and privacy protection; Smart cards,Authentication; Blockchain; Crime; Decision making; Electronic voting; Face recognition; Network security; Voting machines; Block-chain; Data-communication; Decisions makings; Distributed systems; E-Voting; Multi-factor authentication; Secure electronic voting; Security and privacy protection; Verifiability; Voting systems; Smart cards,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,25228595; 25228609,9783031282249; 9783031344589; 9783030298968; 9783031766091; 9783031531606; 9783031530272; 9783031565328; 9783031347498; 9783031601538; 9783031076534,,English,EAI/Springer Inno.

Election in Pakistan is simply paper-based method but some certain political and socio-economic issues turn that simple process in complicated and disputes once. Solutions of such problems are consisting of many methods including the e-voting system. The e-voting system facilitates the voters to cast their votes by electronic means with very easy and convenient way. This also allows maintaining the security and secrecy of the voter along with election process. Electronic voting reduces the human-involvement throughout the process from start to the end. Such system is not established yet in Pakistan. Hence, every election is disputed always. In this paper we proposed the framework of an e-voting system and simulation with the use of blockchain ledger technology. The proposed framework owns the capacity to deal with ballots in Pakistan. The novelty of the framework is that the e-voting system is linked to National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) database which assures voter’s validation. The fundamental requirements were kept in consideration during the performance evaluation of the system. The results are processed and depicted specially with reference to the number of voters and voting stations, real time of vote casting, network bandwidth and controlling principles. The results support the decision makers and guide them in the foundation and customization of an e-voting system in Pakistan. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Blockchain technology; Distributed ledger; E-voting system; Simulation modeling,Blockchain; Decision making; Electronic voting; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; E-voting systems; Economic issues; National database; Pakistan; Paper based methods; Simple++; Simulation-modelling; Socio-economics; Distributed ledger,,Tech Science Press,15462218; 15462226,,,English,Comput.

Beyond its early applications in Finance, it has also allowed the emergence of novel new ways of governance and coordination. The most relevant of these are the so-called Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). DAOs typically implement decision-making systems to make it possible for their online community to reach agreements. As a result of these agreements, the DAO operates automatically by executing the appropriate portion of code on the blockchain network (e.g., hire people, delivers payments, invests in financial products, etc). In the last few years, several platforms such as Aragon, DAOstack and DAOhaus, have emerged to facilitate the creation of DAOs. As a result, hundreds of these new organizations have appeared, with their communities interacting mediated by blockchain. However, the literature has yet to appropriately explore empirically this phenomena. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the current state of the DAO ecosystem. We review the three main platforms nowadays (Aragon, DAOstack, DAOhaus) which facilitate the creation and management of DAOs. Thus, we introduce their main differences, and compare them using quantitative metrics. For such comparison, we retrieve data from both the main Ethereum network (mainnet) and a parallel Ethereum network (xDai). We analyze data from 72,320 users and 2,353 DAO communities in order to study the three ecosystems across four dimensions: growth, activity, voting system and funds. Our results show that there are notable differences among the DAO platforms in terms of growth and activity, and also in terms of voting results. Still, we consider that our work is only a first step and that further research is needed to better understand these communities, and evaluate their level of accomplishment in reaching decentralized governance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Blockchain; DAO; Decentralized autonomous organization; Distributed systems; Ethereum; Governance; Online community; Quantitative research; Voting; xDai,Behavioral research; Decision making; Ecosystems; Electronic voting; Ethereum; Online systems; Social networking (online); Block-chain; Decentralised; Decentralized autonomous organization; Governance; On-line communities; Quantitative research; Voting; Xdai; Blockchain,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,18690238; 18674828,,,English,J.

Such a system poses several issues regarding information security such as data integrity of the election result, the confidentiality of voter identity with its vote and the auditability of transactions. This research presents an implementation of blockchain-based Ethereum on the E-Voting system to protect the information security with a distributed storage. The e-Voting system is implemented with three main components: private blockchain network, smart contract, and web service as an interface to manager and voters. The functional evaluation on the data store, display, update, delete, verify voters, authenticate voters, and the integrity of the election process in the private blockchain network are all well-functioning, even without an overvote. The nonfunctional evaluation shows that the system can guarantee the data integrity of the election result, the confidentiality of voter identity with its selection, the auditability of transactions, and the maximum scale of load that system can handle. Based on these results, E-Voting system with a blockchain-based Ethereum give a better alternative than those implemented with a client-server architecture. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Blockchain; E-Voting; Ethereum; Information Security,Digital storage; Electronic voting; Ethereum; Network architecture; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Web services; Block-chain; Client-server architectures; Contract services; Data store; Distributed applications; Distributed storage; E-Voting; E-voting systems; Functional evaluation; Webs services; Blockchain,,Association for Computing Machinery,,9781450385855; 9781450314398; 9781450396387; 9781450390019; 9781450390217; 9781450348270; 9781450381963; 9781450322485; 9781450348201; 9781450364454,,English,ACM Int.

We identified three major bottlenecks in implementation: (1) division overflow in encryption of voting values for anonymity; (2) large time complexity in tallying, which limited scalability in the number of candidates and voters; and (3) tallying failure due to “no votes” from registered voters. Previous schemes failed at tallying if one (or more) registered voters did not send encrypted voting values. Algorithmic solutions and implementation details are provided. An experiment using Truffle and Remix running on a desktop PC was performed for evaluation. Our scheme shows great reduction in gas, which measures the computational burden of smart contracts to be executed on Ethereum. For instance, our scheme consumed 1/53 of the gas compared to a state-of-the-art solution for 60 voters. Time complexity analysis shows that our scheme is asymptotically superior to known solutions. In addition, we propose a solution to the tallying failure due to the “no vote” from registered voters. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Blockchain; E-Voting; Electronic voting; Ethereum; Scalability,Blockchain; Cryptography; Personal computers; Algorithmic solutions; Computational burden; Scalable implementation; State of the art; Time complexity; Time complexity analysis; Ethereum; politics; system analysis; Politics; Systems Analysis,,MDPI AG,14248220,,,English,Sensors,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107678790

Political parties, observers, and especially voters want to be able to verify that all eligible votes are cast as intended and counted as cast without compromising votes secrecy or voters privacy. Over the past few decades, an important number of e-voting protocols attempt to deal with this issue by using cryptographic techniques and/or a public bulletin board. Recently, some blockchain-based e-voting systems have been proposed, but were not found practical in the real world, because they do not support situations with large numbers of candidates and voters. In this article, we design and implement a verifiable blockchain-based online voting protocol, called verify-your-vote. Our protocol ensures several security properties thanks to some cryptographic primitives and blockchain technology. We also evaluate its performance in terms of time, cost, and the number of voters and candidates that can be supported. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",blockchain technology; cryptographic primitives; e-voting; practical implementation; security and performance evaluation,Cryptography; Electronic voting; Voting machines; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Critical properties; Cryptographic primitives; E-Voting; Performances evaluation; Practical implementation; Secure electronic voting; Security and performance; Security evaluation; Blockchain,,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,15320626; 15320634,,CCPEB,English,Concurr.

Almost all countries follow the voting system in the election process and based on which government has decided. In the past, voting was done manually or through ballot boxes, and many countries still followed this pattern. But nowadays, the E-voting system has come into existence, and they are considered to be fast as they generate results quickly. The major drawback of an E-voting system is the security features, and to overcome this situation and many approaches are developed to enhance the security features. In this paper, the Blockchain approach will be implemented to improve the security features of the Electronic-voting system using the concept of proof of work.

Due to the inherent insecurity of Internet, it is difficult for E-voting to attain complete fairness and robustness. In this study, we argue that Bitcoin blockchain offers better options for a more practical E-voting. We first present a coin mixing-based E-voting system model, which can cut off the relationship between the voter's real identity and its Bitcoin address to achieve strong anonymity. Moreover, we devise a secret sharing-based E-voting protocol, which can prevent voting number from being leaked ahead and further realize strong robustness. We establish the probable security theory to prove its security. In addition, we use the experimental evaluation to demonstrate its efficiency. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Voting machines; Block-chain; Decision control; Distributed decision; E-Voting; Large-scales; Mobile terminal; Secret-sharing; System models; Terminal devices; Voting schemes; Robustness (control systems),,Hindawi Limited,19390114; 19390122,,,English,Secur.

E-voting is one of the most challenging problems in cryptographic research to provide multiple dimensions security assurances. In this paper, we study an important voting paradigm, score voting, with privacy protection, which has not been investigated in previous work. We propose a blockchain based self-tallying election system to support score voting, dubbed 'PriScore', where the ballots are recorded on blockchain to prevent vote forgery or tampering. PriScore makes it possible for each voter to assign different evaluation scores (within a certain range) for the candidates as ranked-choice, where the sum of the scores in each ballot should be a predefined constant, and the evaluation scores are encrypted to maintain confidentiality. A major challenge in score voting is to simultaneously prove two constraint conditions: range proof and sum proof. We introduce a new technique, called dual zero-knowledge proof (dual-ZKP), to prove the scores satisfying two crucial requirements, which integrates '1-out-of-$K$ ' proof and distributed ElGamal crypto in a non-trivial way. The self-tallying mechanism in PriScore enables any party in the system to calculate and verify the election result, which provides fairness, dispute-freeness. The security analysis demonstrates that PriScore achieves completeness, soundness, eligibility, universal/individual verifiability and multiple-voting detection. We evaluate the performance of PriScore on modern workbench to test the performance, and also on a blockchain platform to measure the resource consumption. The experiments show that PriScore preserves privacy of score voting with reasonable overheads. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",1-out-of-K; Blockchain; distributed ElGamal crypto; score voting; self-tallying; zero-knowledge proof,Cryptography; Privacy by design; Collective decision; Constraint conditions; Multiple dimensions; Privacy protection; Resource consumption; Security analysis; Security assurance; Zero knowledge proof; Blockchain,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,15566013,,,English,IEEE Trans.

However, such techniques are typically reactive approaches to identify the root cause of an attack in its aftermath. This is in part due to the fact that the collection of provenance metadata often results in a deluge of information that cannot easily be queried and analyzed in real time. This paper presents an approach for proactively reasoning about provenance metadata within the Automatic Cryptographic Data Centric (ACDC) security architecture, a new security infrastructure in which all data interactions are considered at a coarse granularity, similar to the Function as a Service model. At this scale, we have found that data interactions are manageable for the proactive specification and evaluation of provenance policies—constraints placed on provenance metadata to prevent the consumption of untrusted data. This paper provides a model for proactively evaluating provenance metadata in the ACDC paradigm as well as a case study of an electronic voting scheme to demonstrate the applicability of ACDC and the provenance policies needed to ensure data integrity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Cryptography; Electronic voting; Metadata; Data integrity; Data interactions; Data provenance; Electronic voting scheme; Security Architecture; Security infrastructure; Service Model; System integrity; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS),"Glavic, B.; Braganholo, V.; Koop, D.",Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,16113349; 03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141; 9783031984136,,English,Lect.

However, the e-voting systems have experienced allegations due to corruption and unfair practices including voter impersonation, fraud, or duplicate votes. This has caused a decline in transparency and faith in the electoral process, resulting in reduced participation of citizens in the democratic process. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a blockchain-based e-voting system to ensure the fairness of the electoral process and restore people’s faith while protecting the users’ privacy. First, we utilize face recognition technology to authenticate voters after extracting feature sets from images while users actively make actions. Second, we design a smart contract to secure voter information during the election. Our approach involves analyzing the limitations of the existing electoral voting system and applies the blockchain-based solution to the vulnerable aspects of the existing system. We implement our approach by using Ethereum, smart contract, and OpenCV Haar Cascade detection classifiers, and our evaluation based on the prototype shows that our approach is effective and efficient. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Blockchain; E-voting; Ethereum; Privacy preserving; Smart contract,Blockchain; Classification (of information); Crime; Face recognition; Privacy by design; Cascade detections; Democratic process; E-voting systems; Electronic voting systems; Existing systems; Extracting features; Face recognition technologies; Privacy preserving; Electronic voting,"Park, Y.; Jadav, D.; Austin, T.",Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,18650937; 18650929,9789819671748; 9789819664610; 9783032026743; 9783032008831; 9783032026712; 9789819671779; 9783031949425; 9789819666874; 9783031936968; 9783031941207,,English,Commun.

Centralized systems in a network result in data sources coming from one party having the right to store and to manage data sources. The issue of trust caused by a centralized data distribution system can be overcome by spreading data in a system network. Blockchain is a distributed ledger, where every party in the network has the same data source, and it has a powerful characteristic known as immutability which is very suitable for e-voting system.

In this paper we present a new electronic voting scheme, HSE-voting, to lighten the workload of tallying. The cryptographic approach of this scheme is homomorphic signcryption, whose signature homomorphism enables that the number of signature verifications depends on the number of candidates only, and the encryption homomorphism keeps ballots from being decrypted during the tallying process. Moreover, for voters, the encryption and signature of ballots can be completed in one step using the homomorphic signcryption. Finally, this paper gives proofs for the privacy of voters and the security and verifiability of voting, and provides a comparative analysis with the latest scheme. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Electronic voting; Homomorphic signcryption; Proof of partial knowledge; Voting privacy,Cryptography; Voting machines; Comparative analysis; Digital signature algorithms; Electronic voting scheme; High-efficiency; Partial knowledge; Signature verification; Signcryption; Verification process; Electronic voting,,Elsevier B.V.,0167739X,,FGCSE,English,Future Gener Comput Syst,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074894833

However, challenges remain to the achieving of wide spread adoption of such systems, especially with respect to improving their resilience against potential faults. Blockchain is a disruptive technology of the current era and promises to improve the overall resilience of e-voting systems. This article presents an effort to leverage benefits of blockchain such as cryptographic foundations and transparency to achieve an effective scheme for e-voting. The proposed scheme conforms to the fundamental requirements for e-voting schemes and achieves end-to-end verifiability.

Over the past few years, voting turnout has diminished as concerns regarding security, privacy, accessibility and integrity have been escalated. In order to address these issues, e-voting was introduced; however, only a few countries managed to use the application due to cost and central authority approvals. Hence, blockchain technology is an emerging platform as it allows decentralization through the use of distributed technology, expanding industries and processes. In this chapter, the researchers will discuss the significance of blockchain e-voting applications as well as provide details of the issues faced by current blockchain technologies. A comparative analysis of existing mechanisms is also provided in order to understand and mitigate the gaps before fully adopting blockchain technologies for e-voting applications.

It has been widely applied to solve many privacy-preservation problems such as privacy-preserving data mining, secure auction, secure electronic voting, and privacy-preserving statistical data analysis. To guarantee the correctness of the final output and to enhance the security level, the existing secure multi-party sum protocols have to use authenticated channels, even secure channels for participants to communicate, however such a usage requirement significantly reduces their performance. Furthermore, these secure multi-party sum protocols are impossible to run on public networks. In this paper, we propose a new secure multi-party sum protocol that can ensure the correctness of the output result as well as securely protecting the parties’ privacy against attacks without requiring any authenticated/secure channel. The proposed protocol is based on a multi-party sum function employing a variant of ElGamal encryption and a Schnorr signature-derived authentication method, in which both these cryptographic tools use the same private and public keys.

Therefore, government decision-makers and election stakeholders do not yet have a sufficient basis to understand the potential risks, challenges, and prospects that are associated with blockchain e-voting. This paper demonstrates how the use of the Architecture Trade-off Analysis Method (ATAM) can enable stakeholders in national elections to understand the risks, prospects, and challenges that could be associated with a blockchain e-voting system for national elections. By using a study context of South Africa, a proposed blockchain e-voting architecture was used as a basis to aid election stakeholders to reason on the concept of blockchain e-voting to get them to understand the potential risks, security threats, critical requirements attributes, and weaknesses that could be associated with using blockchain e-voting for national elections. The study found that blockchain e-voting can prevent many security attacks, internal vote manipulation, and promote transparency. However, voter validation and the security of the blockchain architecture are potential weaknesses that will need significant attention. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Architecture Trade-off Analysis Method (ATAM), requirements engineering; Blockchain; Electronic voting; Smart contracts; Software architecture",,,MDPI AG diversity@mdpi.com,22279709,,,English,Informatics,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091760555

Our objective in doing so is to highlight conditions which cause such attack to facilitate the development of protection mechanisms for them. Specifically, this paper presents a successful simulation of transaction malleability attack within the context of blockchain-based electronic voting.

Two ‘principled’ methods are risk-limiting audits (RLAs) and Bayesian audits (BAs). RLAs use frequentist statistical inference while BAs are based on Bayesian inference. Until recently, the two have been thought of as fundamentally different. We present results that unify and shed light upon ‘ballot-polling’ RLAs and BAs (which only require the ability to sample uniformly at random from all cast ballot cards) for two-candidate plurality contests, that are building blocks for auditing more complex social choice functions, including some preferential voting systems. We highlight the connections between the methods and explore their performance. First, building on a previous demonstration of the mathematical equivalence of classical and Bayesian approaches, we show that BAs, suitably calibrated, are risk-limiting. Second, we compare the efficiency of the methods across a wide range of contest sizes and margins, focusing on the distribution of sample sizes required to attain a given risk limit. Third, we outline several ways to improve performance and show how the mathematical equivalence explains the improvements. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bayesian; Risk-limiting; Statistical audit,Bayesian networks; III-V semiconductors; Inference engines; Statistical methods; Voting machines; Bayesian approaches; Bayesian inference; Improve performance; Mathematical equivalences; Preferential voting; Risk-limiting audits; Social choice functions; Statistical inference; Electronic voting,"Krimmer, R.; Duenas-Cid, D.; Krimmer, R.; Volkamer, M.; Beckert, B.; Küsters, R.; Kulyk, O.; Duenas-Cid, D.; Solvak, M.",Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,16113349; 03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141; 9783031984136,,English,Lect.

It consists of the automated security evaluation of enterprise IoT devices and the creation of a dynamic insurance premium. To automate the security evaluation of enterprise IoT devices, we collect and store IoT device status data with privacy preservation on blockchain. Then, we track and assess the risk associated with IoT devices with the use of a smart contract. By monitoring this risk over time, we present a means to incentivize the resolution of vulnerabilities by measuring the latent risk in an environment as well as the vigilance of the devices’ managers in resolving these vulnerabilities. In this way, we produce a dynamic cyber insurance premium that more accurately captures the risk profile associated with an environment than existing cyber insurance. Through the use blockchain and smart contracts, this framework also provides public verification for both insured and insurer and provides a level of risk management for the insurer. We also present regulatory considerations in order for this scheme to meet supervisory requirements. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Blockchain; Cyber insurance; Cyber security; Information security; Privacy preservation; Regulation awareness; Smart contract,Blockchain; Chromium compounds; Cryptography; Electronic voting; Insurance; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security of data; Device status; Incentive mechanism; Insurance premiums; Privacy preservation; Public verifications; Regulatory considerations; Risk profile; Security evaluation; Internet of things,"Bernhard, M.; Bracciali, A.; Camp, L.J.; Matsuo, S.; Maurushat, A.; Rønne, P.B.; Sala, M.",Springer,16113349; 03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141; 9783031984136,,English,Lect.

Leveraging the immutability and accountability of blockchains, these event-driven programs form the basis of the new digital economy with tokens, wallets, exchanges, and markets, but facilitating also new models of peer-to-peer organizations. To judge the long-term prospects of particular projects and this new technology in general, it is important to understand how smart contracts are used. While public announcements, by their nature, make promises of what smart contracts might achieve, openly available data of blockchains provides a more balanced view on what is actually going on. We focus on Ethereum as the major platform for smart contracts and aim at a comprehensive picture of the smart contract landscape regarding common or heavily used types of contracts. To this end, we unravel the publicly available data of the main chain up to block 9 000 000, in order to obtain an understanding of almost 20 million deployed smart contracts and 1.5 billion interactions. As smart contracts act behind the scenes, their activities are only fully accessible by also considering the execution traces triggered by transactions. They serve as the basis for this analysis, in which we group contracts according to common characteristics, observe temporal aspects and characterize them quantitatively and qualitatively. We use static methods by analyzing the bytecode of contracts as well as dynamic methods by aggregating and classifying the communication between contracts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bytecode analysis; Empirical study; EVM; Execution trace; Smart contract; Transaction data,Blockchain; Chromium compounds; Cryptography; Electronic voting; Finance; Security of data; Digital economy; Dynamic method; Event-driven; Execution trace; Main chains; Peer to peer; Static method; Temporal aspects; Ethereum,"Bernhard, M.; Bracciali, A.; Camp, L.J.; Matsuo, S.; Maurushat, A.; Rønne, P.B.; Sala, M.",Springer,16113349; 03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141; 9783031984136,,English,Lect.

Blockchain technology is being used in many applications majorly in cryptocurrencies and bitcoin applications. Verified transactions which make a block and group of such transactions or blocks are immutable making the blockchain more secured and reliable. Blockchain achieves decentralization of power, trust, and secured of being hacked, which solves major problems or issues with the current systems. Ethereum, the most widely used blockchain platform because of its unlimited block size. Many complex problems with smart contracts can be implemented with Ethereum and the eradication of third party organizations interfering in transactions helps solving the issues of financial crisis and it is easy to implement compared to other blockchain technologies. There are certain limitations/issues in processing large number of transactions due to lack of speed in processing the transactions. Ethereum Blockchain code will be executed by different clients with varying speed and the performance level will be different. The goal of this paper is to understand Ethereum transactions and perform the comparative analysis of Geth and Parity ethereum clients on the private blockchain. In this paper, a private blockchain network is setup where the nodes will share the data among peer nodes or blocks within the network. Using this network setup a democracy voting application is developed which makes use of the blockchain to store and process the data, smart contracts are deployed to execute the transactions. Performance analysis of the two most popular ethereum clients Geth and Parity is carried out considering time, consistency and scalability parameters. Results interpret that the overall transactions are 91% on average faster in parity client as compared to Geth client. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Blockchain; consensus; Ethereum; Geth; Parity; Proof-of-stake; Proof-of-work,Artificial intelligence; Cryptocurrency; Ethereum; Block sizes; Comparative analysis; Complex problems; Financial crisis; Network setup; Performance analysis; Performance level; Third parties; Blockchain,"Singh, V.; Asari, V.K.; Li, K.-C.",Elsevier B.V.,18770509,9781510849914,,English,Procedia Comput.

If the voters cannot complete the tasks by themselves or experience bad usability while executing them, vote manipulations by either a faulty software or deliberate attacks cannot be detected which renders verification useless. Therefore, the scheme’s usability is of crucial importance and demands an early investigation of human factors when implementing e-voting systems. In this paper, we give an overview of user study design challenges when investigating end-to-end verifiable e-voting schemes.

Secure electronic voting is a vision for the future of elections and referendums. Such a system can counteract factors that hinder strong voter turnout such as the requirement of physical presence during limited hours at polling stations. However, this vision brings transparency and confidentiality requirements that render the design of such solutions challenging. Specifically, the counting must be implemented in a reproducible way and the ballots of individual voters must remain concealed. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a referendum protocol that ensures transparency, confidentiality and integrity, in trustless networks. The protocol is built by combining Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) and Distributed Ledger or Blockchain technology. The persistence and immutability of the protocol communication allows verifiability of the referendum outcome on the client side. Voters therefore do not need to trust in third parties.

We moreover formalize and machine-check the proof in the EasyCrypt theorem prover. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",computer aided security proofs; cryptographic protocols; electronic voting; security models,Computation theory; Cryptography; Malware; Complex infrastructures; Computational capability; Computing platform; Cryptographic protocols; Evaluation methods; Indistinguishability; Security model; Security proofs; Electronic voting,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781728111476,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Eur.

First, we introduce one-shot proof techniques for non-linear polynomial relations of degree&#x0024;&#x0024;k\ge 2&#x0024;&#x0024;, where the protocol achieves a negligible soundness error in a single execution, and thus performs significantly better in both computation and communication compared to prior protocols requiring multiple repetitions. Such proofs with degree&#x0024;&#x0024;k\ge 2&#x0024;&#x0024; have been crucial ingredients for important privacy-preserving protocols in the discrete logarithm setting, such as Bulletproofs (IEEE S&P ’18) and arithmetic circuit arguments (EUROCRYPT ’16). In contrast, one-shot proofs in lattice-based cryptography have previously only been shown for the linear case (&#x0024;&#x0024;k=1&#x0024;&#x0024; ) and a very specific quadratic case (&#x0024;&#x0024;k=2&#x0024;&#x0024; ), which are obtained as a special case of our technique. Moreover, we introduce two speedup techniques for lattice-based ZKPs: a CRT-packing technique supporting “inter-slot” operations, and “NTT-friendly” tools that permit the use of fully-splitting rings. The former technique comes at almost no cost to the proof length, and the latter one barely increases it, which can be compensated for by tweaking the rejection sampling parameters while still having faster computation overall. To illustrate the utility of our techniques, we show how to use them to build efficient relaxed proofs for important relations, namely proof of commitment to bits, one-out-of-many proof, range proof and set membership proof. Despite their relaxed nature, we further show how our proof systems can be used as building blocks for advanced cryptographic tools such as ring signatures. Our ring signature achieves a dramatic improvement in length over all the existing proposals from lattices at the same security level. The computational evaluation also shows that our construction is highly likely to outperform all the relevant works in running times. Being efficient in both aspects, our ring signature is particularly suitable for both small-scale and large-scale applications such as cryptocurrencies and e-voting systems. No trusted setup is required for any of our proposals. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",CRT packing; Lattice-based cryptography; One-out-of-many proof; Range proof; Ring signature; Set membership proof; Zero-knowledge proof,Authentication; Network security; Lattice-based cryptography; One-out-of-many proof; Range proof; Ring signatures; Set membership; Zero knowledge proof; Cryptography,"Micciancio, D.; Boldyreva, A.",Springer Verlag service@springer.de,16113349; 03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141; 9783031984136,,English,Lect.

Tokens on the blockchain as a technological concept is the closest solution to the legal concept of titles, because it provides for evidence of ownership and can be transferred from one address to another, while giving exclusive access to such an address to the owner. This paper contains the analysis of the concept of tokens in the context of its applicability to title rights on real estate. There is also a discussion of the outcomes of conducted interviews with professionals in the field of Computer Science, technologies, blockchain and smart contracts. Some critical mismatches were found: tokens are not able to satisfy current demand to manage title rights online. To develop a mature and sustainable electronic system, there are certain issues that need to be addressed: inheritance procedures, litigation, guardianship, delegation of rights and rights of third parties (liens and encumbrances) as well as the legal concept of bundle of rights (possession, disposition, enjoyment, etc.), which requires a strong mathematical model. During the abovementioned interviews, some weaknesses were found in the existing ideas of the use of the blockchain for real estate, mostly related to the undesirable centralization and issues with security. As the result of this research, it is obvious what needs to be developed is the concept of a high-level design of the technology, capable of managing title rights on the blockchain, which includes a three-level mechanism of (1) e-voting, which provides for a democratic implementation of governing algorithms; (2) Smart Laws, as the concept of high level “smart” algorithms that implement (by e-voting) existing laws related to property rights in a form of the program/protocol; and (3) smart contract templates which are based on the smart laws, that allow people to manage their title rights online. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Blockchain; E-Democracy; E-Governance; E-Voting; Real estate; Smart contracts; Titles; Tokens,Blockchain; Chromium compounds; Cryptography; Laws and legislation; E-democracy; E-governance; Real estate; Titles; Tokens; Electronic voting,"Sala, M.; Eyal, I.; Pintore, F.; Bracciali, A.; Zohar, A.; Clark, J.; Teague, V.",Springer Verlag service@springer.de,16113349; 03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141; 9783031984136,,English,Lect.

However, unlike traditional paper-based voting systems, an e-polling system introduces several security risks such as privacy of vote, unlinkability of a voter, voter coercion, secrecy of partial election results, verifiability, and poll integrity. The authenticity of a voter is another security concern, i.e., a voter must be identified through an authentication mechanism that prevents voting of unauthorized voters or multiple voting from authorized voters. Another security concern is the manipulation of votes by an infected (e.g., virus, malware, and so on) voting device. Since the voters use their personal devices to cast votes in an unsupervised environment, a malware-hosted device could make unauthorized modifications to the voter's voting choices. Many e-voting systems have been proposed, however, to date, all these schemes either fail to provide all the required security properties or are not practically feasible on light-weight computing devices. In this paper, we present a secure and verifiable polling system, SeVEP, that employs well-known cryptographic primitives to provide vote and voter's privacy, and poll integrity, confirms the identity of voters through a multifactor authentication scheme, enables multiple voting within the allowed polling period, prevents double voting, and achieves verifiability and uncoercibility in the presence of untrusted voting device. The security, performance, and comparative analysis in terms of security properties and cryptographic costs show that SeVEP is secure, verifiable, and practical e-polling system. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Authentication; efficiency; electronic polling; malware; security; verifiability,Authentication; Computer crime; Cryptography; Data privacy; Efficiency; Malware; Surveys; Viruses; Authentication mechanisms; Comparative analysis; Cryptographic primitives; Electronic pollings; Multi-factor authentication; security; Unauthorized modification; Verifiability; Voting machines,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062449644

End-to-end verifiable e-voting schemes facilitate verification of the integrity of individual votes during the election process. In particular, methods for cast-as-intended verification enable voters to confirm that their cast votes have not been manipulated by the voting client. A well-known technique for effecting cast-asintended verification is the Benaloh Challenge.

Blockchain is a disruptive technology of the current era and promises to improve the overall resilience of e-voting systems. This article presents an effort to leverage benefits of blockchain such as cryptographic foundations and transparency to achieve an effective scheme for e-voting. The proposed scheme conforms to the fundamental requirements for e-voting schemes and achieves end-to-end verifiability.

Among these applications, the blinded message is needed for a certain purpose by which users delegate signing operation and communicate with each other in a trusted manner. This application leads to the need of proxy blind signature schemes. Proxy blind signature is an important type of cryptographic primitive to realize the properties of both blind signature and proxy signature. Over the past years, many proxy blind signature algorithms have been adopted to fulfill such task based on the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) and the elliptic curve discrete log problem (ECDLP), and most of the existing studies mainly aim to provide effective models to satisfy the security requirements concerning a single blinded message. Unlike many previous works, the proposed scheme applies the signcryption paradigm to the proxy blind signature technology for handling multiple blinded messages at a time based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). This innovative method thus has a higher level of security to achieve the security goals of both blind signature and proxy signature. Moreover, the evaluation results show that this proposed protocol is more efficient, consuming low communication overhead while increasing the volume of digital messages compared to the performance from other solutions. Due to these features, this design is able to be implemented in small low-power intelligent devices and very suitable and easily adoptable for e-system applications in pervasive mobile computing environment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Elliptic curve cryptography; Proxy blind signature; Signcryption,Authentication; Electronic document identification systems; Geometry; Network security; Public key cryptography; Communication overheads; Cryptographic primitives; Discrete logarithm problems; Elliptic curve cryptography; Elliptic Curve Cryptography(ECC); Mobile computing environment; Proxy blind signature; Signcryption; Cryptography,,"Korean Society for Internet Information 4th Floor, Unsan Building, 646-6 Yeoksam 1-Dong, Gangnam-Gu, 135-911",22881468; 19767277,,,English,KSII Trans.

It is typical of such crypto protocols that participating parties need to repeatedly verify that certain equations over bilinear groups are satisfied, e.g., to check that computed signatures are valid, commitments can be opened, or non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs verify correctly. Depending on the form and number of equations this part can quickly become a performance bottleneck due to the costly evaluation of the bilinear map. To ease this burden on the verifier, batch verification techniques have been proposed that allow to combine and check multiple equations probabilistically using less operations than checking each equation individually. In this work, we revisit the batch verification problem and existing standard techniques. We introduce a new technique which, in contrast to previous work, enables us to fully exploit the structure of certain systems of equations. Equations of the appropriate form naturally appear in many protocols, e.g., due to the use of Groth-Sahai proofs. The beauty of our technique is that the underlying idea is pretty simple:we observe that many systems of equations can alternatively be viewed as a single equation of products of polynomials for which probabilistic polynomial identity testing following Schwartz-Zippel can be applied. Comparisons show that our approach can lead to significant improvements in terms of the number of pairing evaluations. Indeed, for the BeleniosRF voting system presented at CCS 2016, we can reduce the number of pairings (required for ballot verification) from 4k + 140, as originally reported by Chaidos et al. [19], to k +7. As our implementation and benchmarks demonstrate, this may reduce the verification runtime to only 5% to 13% of the original runtime. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Batch Verification; Belenios; Bilinear Maps; Groth-sahai Proofs; P-Signatures; Structurepreserving Cryptography,Cryptography; Network protocols; Voting machines; Batch verification; Belenios; Bilinear map; Groth-sahai Proofs; Structure-preserving; Network security,,Association for Computing Machinery acmhelp@acm.org,15437221,9781605583006; 9781450310031; 9781605587783; 9781605587899; 9781450368315; 9781450360043; 9781605587882; 9781595938855; 9781450316507; 9781605587868,,English,Proc ACM Conf Computer Commun Secur,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041435972

The proposed e-voting system is based on the concept of Prêt à Voter, which is a paper ballot e-voting scheme. Mixnet based e-voting schemes such as Prêt à Voter use mix servers to create anonymous channels. These schemes have some shortcomings; Mixnets need complex protocols for generating and maintaining shared mix keys, as well as for mixing and proving correctness of the shuffles. Moreover, Mixnets are complex to implement on a large scale. Mixnets are also vulnerable to corrupt or faulty mix servers as well. The proposed e-voting scheme eliminates the need for anonymous channels to anonymize the votes in Mixnet based e-voting schemes, yet provides comparable level of security and vote anonymity with less system complexity. The proposed e-voting scheme uses paper ballots, due to its familiarity among the public, but with strong cryptographic algorithms with proven security features, to provide enhanced level of ballot secrecy, verifiability and security. The proposed scheme is simple, secure, practical, and auditable. Security evaluation is conducted based on the critical and desirable properties of e-voting to support the claimed aspects. Threat analysis of the proposed e-voting system had been conducted to prove its resistance to well-known attacks on e-voting schemes and systems. A proof of concept implementation and simulation of the proposed e-voting scheme was developed to elucidate its efficiency, practicality, and scalability. The research proposal has the potential to be deployed as a trustworthy e-voting system, to replace the conventional voting methods in developing countries. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cryptography; Electronic voting; Secret ballot; Security; Verifiability,Cryptography; Developing countries; Cryptographic algorithms; Electronic voting; Electronic voting systems; Middle East and North Africa; Secret ballot; Security; Security evaluation; Verifiability; Voting machines,,Elsevier Ltd,22142134; 22142126,,,English,J.

This so-called “end-to-end (E2E) verifiability” is the hallmark of current e-voting protocols; nevertheless, thorough analysis of current systems is still far from being complete. In this work, we initiate the study of e-voting protocols as ceremonies. A ceremony, as introduced by Ellison [23], is an extension of the notion of a protocol that includes human participants as separate nodes of the system that should be taken into account when performing the security analysis. that centers on the two properties of end-to-end verifiability and voter privacy and allows the consideration of arbitrary behavioural distributions for the human participants. We then analyse the Helios system as an e-voting ceremony. Security in the e-voting ceremony model requires the specification of a class of human behaviours with respect to which the security properties can be preserved. We show how end-to-end verifiability and voter privacy are sensitive to human behaviour in the protocol by characterizing the set of behaviours under which the security can be preserved and also showing explicit scenarios where it fails. We then provide experimental evaluation with human subjects from two different sources where people used Helios: the elections of the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) and a poll of senior year computer science students. We report on the auditing behaviour of the participants as we measured it and we discuss the effects on the level of certainty that can be given by each of the two electorates. The outcome of our analysis is a negative one: the auditing behaviour of people (including cryptographers) is not sufficient to ensure the correctness of the tally with good probability in either case studied. The same holds true even for simulated data that capture the case of relatively well trained participants while, finally, the security of the ceremony can be shown but under the assumption of essentially ideally behaving human subjects. We note that while our results are stated for Helios, they automatically transfer to various other e-voting systems that, as Helios, rely on client-side encryption to encode the voter’s choice. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Computer privacy; Cryptography; Data privacy; Differential privacy; Network security; Voting machines; E-Voting; E-voting protocols; E-voting systems; End to end; End-to-end verifiability; Human behaviors; Human subjects; State of the art; Verifiable Elections; Voter privacies; Electronic voting,"Fehr, S.",Springer Verlag,16113349; 03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141; 9783031984136,,English,Lect.

Prior internet voting systems have single points of failure, which may result in the compromise of availability, voter secrecy, or integrity of the election results. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, security analysis, and evaluation of D-DEMOS, a complete e-voting system that is distributed, privacy-preserving and end-to-end verifiable. Our system includes a fully asynchronous vote collection subsystem that provides immediate assurance to the voter her vote was recorded as cast, without requiring cryptographic operations on behalf of the voter. We also include a distributed, replicated and fault-tolerant Bulletin Board component, that stores all necessary election-related information, and allows any party to read and verify the complete election process. Finally, we also incorporate trustees, i.e., individuals who control election result production while guaranteeing privacy and end-to-end-verifiability as long as their strong majority is honest. Our system is the first e-voting system whose voting operation is human verifiable, i.e., a voter can vote over the web, even when her web client stack is potentially unsafe, without sacrificing her privacy, and still be assured her vote was recorded as cast. Additionally, a voter can outsource election auditing to third parties, still without sacrificing privacy. Finally, as the number of auditors increases, the probability of election fraud going undetected is diminished exponentially. We provide a model and security analysis of the system. We implement a prototype of the complete system, we measure its performance experimentally, and we demonstrate its ability to handle large-scale elections. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",distributed system; privacy; reliability; security; Voting system,Data privacy; Fault tolerant computer systems; Internet; Reliability; Security systems; Voting machines; Cryptographic operations; Distributed systems; End-to-end verifiability; Internet voting system; Large scale election; Privacy preserving; security; Voting systems; Distributed computer systems,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781509014828,PICSE,English,Proc Int Conf Distrib Comput Syst,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84985905223

A new and promising application area of electronic voting is boardroom voting, which in practice takes place very frequently and often on simple issues such as approving or refusing a budget. Hence, it is not a surprise that a number of cryptographic protocols for boardroom voting have been already proposed. In this work, we introduce a security model adequate for the boardroom voting context.

The authors conclude the chapter with a summary of the evaluation results, which can serve as guideline for decision-makers. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,IGI Global,,9781466658202; 9781466658219; 1466658207,,English,"Des., Dev., and Use of Secur.

This is achieved by adapting the ballot generation and anonymisation process, such that only unconditional hiding commitments and zero knowledge proofs are published for verification, thus ensuring privacy towards the public. This paper presents a security analysis carried out in a collaboration between computer scientists and legal researchers. On the technical side it is shown that the modified Prêt à Voter provides verifiability, robustness, and everlasting privacy towards the public. Everlasting privacy towards the authorities can be achieved by implementing several organisational measures. A legal evaluation of these measures demonstrates that the level of privacy achieved would be acceptable under German law. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",cryptographic voting schemes; design and evaluation of e-Voting systems; everlasting privacy; legal issues; Prêt à Voter,Computer scientists; Cryptographic voting; E-voting systems; Legal issues; Organisational; Security analysis; Verifiability; Zero knowledge proof; Voting machines; Data privacy,,,16113349; 03029743,9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141; 9783031984136,,English,Lect.

A lot of precious information is currently released by users with no privacy control whenever they evaluate resources, which, for example, is done in Facebook through the ""Like Button"". A mechanism allowing the user to express her preferences fully preserving her privacy is thus desired, especially if it is able to protect user privacy also in case of untrustworthy social network provider. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem, based on a DHT-based P2P social network and on a cryptographic protocol relying on partially blind digital signatures. The protocol is shown to be a solution to the trade-off between feasibility and security, since it guarantees the needed security requirements without including the complex features of existing e-voting systems. © 2012 IEEE. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,Cryptographic protocols; E-voting systems; Facebook; Privacy control; Privacy preserving; Resource evaluation; Security requirements; Social Networks; User privacy; Data privacy; Network security; Voting machines; Social networking (online),,,,9781467323260,,English,"Annu.

Some solutions, the most common e-voting systems, are presented in the paper. These models are adjusted to the demands and implemented in the polls system for quality of teaching evaluation where anonymity is very important.

System security is the problem of cryptographic security, user's authorization, limited access and protection against frauds. The anonymity is another important issue, because a guarantee that the voters are anonymous is reflected in the reliability of casted votes. Authorization and anonymity seems to be contradictory but it possible to separate both procedures. The problems of polls for teaching quality evaluation are similar. The polls need to be available only for authorized students but they also need to be filled in anonymously.

Several people advocate the benefits it can bringsuch as improved speed and accuracy in counting, accessibility, voting from homeand as many are concerned with the risks it poses, such as unequal access (digital divide), violation to secrecy and anonymity, alteration of the results of an election (because of malicious attacks, bad design/coding, or procedural weaknesses). The attitude of different governments towards electronic voting (e-voting) varies accordingly. In this paper, we present the activities related to the development and formal verification of an e-voting system, called ProVotE. ProVotE is an end-to-end e-voting system with a voter verified paper audit trial, developed within the framework of a larger initiative whose goal is assessing the feasibility of introducing e-voting in the Autonomous Province of Trento. ProVotE has been used in trials and elections with legal value in Italy. What we believe to be of interest is the approach we took for its development, which has been based on a participatory design for the definition of the voter interface, on the usage of formal methods and model checking for the validation of the core logic of the machine, on open source components, and on the formal analysis of some critical procedures related to the usage of the machine during the election. © 2006 IEEE. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Development; Electronic voting (e-voting); Formal specification and verification; ProVotE; Security assessment,Digital divide; E-Voting; E-voting systems; Electronic voting; Formal analysis; Formal specification and verification; Formal verifications; Malicious attack; New technologies; Open-source components; Participatory design; Security assessment; Machine components; Machine design; Model checking; Network security; Specifications; Voting machines; Formal methods,,,15566013,,,English,IEEE Trans.
