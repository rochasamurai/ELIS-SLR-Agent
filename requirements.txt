# =============================================================================
# ELIS SLR Agent — Runtime dependencies (CI "validate" stage)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Scope
#   Only the packages required by scripts/validate_json.py at runtime.
#   Developer tools (Ruff, Black, pytest) are installed by GitHub Actions
#   workflows and must not be listed here to avoid environment drift.
#
# Reproducibility
#   Pin exact versions so CI is deterministic across runners and time.
# =============================================================================

# JSON Schema validator used by scripts/validate_json.py

#   as expected and the report renders correctly.
