# SEARCH CONFIGURATION: Electoral Integrity SLR
# ==============================================================================
# 
# Purpose: Systematic literature review on electoral integrity strategies,
#          auditability, and empirical evaluation frameworks across all
#          types of electoral systems (paper, electronic, hybrid).
#
# Research Questions:
#   PRQ: What operational and technological strategies have been shown to 
#        improve the integrity or auditability of electoral systems since 1990?
#   
#   MSQ: What types of empirical designs and evaluation frameworks have been 
#        used to assess the effectiveness of electoral integrity strategies 
#        since 1990?
#
# This is the native ELIS SLR Agent project configuration for comprehensive
# research on electoral systems, integrity, and evaluation methodologies.

    QUERY RATIONALE:
    
    1. Multi-Component Structure (Option 3):
       - Component 1 (Electoral Systems): Captures ALL electoral contexts
       - Component 2 (Integrity): Focuses on core research domain
       - Component 3 (Research Focus): Dual coverage of strategies AND evaluation
    
    2. Why This Works:
       - Addresses BOTH research questions (PRQ + MSQ)
       - Covers all electoral system types (not just e-voting)
       - Includes both intervention studies AND methodological research
       - Precise enough to avoid noise, broad enough for comprehensive coverage
    
    3. Expected Coverage:
       - PRQ studies: Electoral integrity strategies and interventions
       - MSQ studies: Empirical designs and evaluation frameworks
       - Both: Studies that propose AND evaluate strategies
    
    4. Flexibility:
       - Alternative simplified queries for limited databases
       - Expanded keywords documented for reference
       - Can be refined based on pilot search results
    
    5. Estimated Results: 5,000-15,000 studies (manageable for SLR)

search_strategy:
  approach: "Comprehensive systematic search with dual research focus"
  
  rationale: |
    This search strategy is designed to address both research questions:
    
    PRQ (Strategies): What operational and technological strategies improve
                      electoral integrity or auditability?
    - Captured by Component 3a: strategy, intervention, reform, improvement
    - Combined with electoral systems (Component 1) and integrity (Component 2)
    
    MSQ (Evaluation): What empirical designs and frameworks assess effectiveness
                      of electoral integrity strategies?
    - Captured by Component 3b: empirical, framework, evaluation, assessment
    - Combined with electoral systems (Component 1) and integrity (Component 2)
    
    The OR operator in Component 3 ensures we capture:
    - Studies proposing strategies (PRQ focus)
    - Studies evaluating strategies (MSQ focus)

  MAJOR UPDATE v2.0.0: Query Revised to Address Research Questions
  
  Previous version focused narrowly on e-voting. This version:
  
  1. Broadened Scope:
     - ALL electoral systems (paper, electronic, hybrid)
     - NOT just e-voting technology
  
  2. Dual Research Focus:
     - PRQ: Strategies that improve integrity/auditability
     - MSQ: Empirical designs and evaluation frameworks
  
  3. Multi-Component Query:
     - Component 1: Electoral systems (broad coverage)
     - Component 2: Integrity dimensions (core focus)
     - Component 3: Research focus (strategies OR evaluation)
  
  4. Expected Impact:
     - Higher total results: 5,000-15,000 (vs 2,000-8,000)
     - Broader coverage: Paper + electronic + hybrid systems
     - Better alignment: Directly addresses both RQs
