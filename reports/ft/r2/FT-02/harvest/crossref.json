      "abstract": "<p>This chapter concentrates on the consequences of electoral problems, arguing that voters may alter their voting decisions if they believe the election is seriously flawed. Although the electoral integrity literature has touched upon many dimensions of the phenomenon, we still have minimal knowledge of how citizens respond to failures of electoral integrity when voting is considered. This chapter analyses how and when electoral malpractice shapes citizens' voting perceptions by focusing on the dynamics of the 2019 İstanbul repeat elections.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>This chapter analyses the link between electoral integrity and trust in government. It argues that as the credibility of the elections worldwide appears, more and more are called into distrust owing to doubts about false news, widespread voter fraud, voter intimidation, cyber-attacks and gerrymandering. Findings presented in this chapter show that if citizens believe that the election has been rigged, they start to question the very foundations of democratic governance. It can be particularly damaging in countries where the rule of law is weak, as it raises questions about the ability of the government to ensure that other aspects of governance are also conducted fairly and transparently.</p>",

It argues that as the credibility of the elections worldwide appears, more and more are called into distrust owing to doubts about false news, widespread voter fraud, voter intimidation, cyber-attacks and gerrymandering. Findings presented in this chapter show that if citizens believe that the election has been rigged, they start to question the very foundations of democratic governance. It can be particularly damaging in countries where the rule of law is weak, as it raises questions about the ability of the government to ensure that other aspects of governance are also conducted fairly and transparently.</p>",

The chapter argues that a better understanding of the range of rival traditions can help researchers choose appropriate tools and strategies for engaging with electoral stakeholders and the wider world. The chapter sets out three rival research traditions that have been used to study electoral integrity: behavioralism, historiography, and critical sociology. Each is presented as a classical, diametrically opposed approach on questions such as the nature of social science, causal inference, and the normative role of the researcher. However, they also have overlaps. The behavioralist approach, which has its origins in microeconomics, positivism and some traditions in psychology, has tended to dominate the study of elections since the 1960s. Yet, it is only one of the available traditions. Traditions such as historiography, critical sociology, and others offer alternative pathways. The study of electoral integrity can therefore be enriched by using a wider array of approaches and disciplines. Methodological pluralism should be encouraged and recognized to grapple with the evolving nature of electoral integrity challenges.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Do formal electoral systems determine how far contests meet international standards of electoral integrity? This question touches on some classic debates in the literature seeking to understand the reasons underlying electoral reforms and the effects of these changes. To examine these issues, the first part of this chapter develops the conceptual framework to unpack the meaning of electoral integrity. The second part builds upon this understanding and sets out several alternative theoretical arguments of why list proportional representation (PR) electoral systems are generally believed to strengthen of electoral integrity more effectively than majoritarian rules. The third part explains the evidence and data, including how electoral integrity is measured worldwide through the rolling expert survey on Perceptions of Electoral Integrity. The fourth part presents the results of the analysis. The conclusion considers the findings and implications for strengthening electoral integrity and democracy around the globe.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Do formal electoral systems determine how far contests meet international standards of electoral integrity? This question touches on some classic debates in the literature seeking to understand the reasons underlying electoral reforms and the effects of these changes. To examine these issues, the first part of this chapter develops the conceptual framework to unpack the meaning of electoral integrity. The second part builds upon this understanding and sets out several alternative theoretical arguments of why list proportional representation (PR) electoral systems are generally believed to strengthen of electoral integrity more effectively than majoritarian rules. The third part explains the evidence and data, including how electoral integrity is measured worldwide through the rolling expert survey on Perceptions of Electoral Integrity. The fourth part presents the results of the analysis. The conclusion considers the findings and implications for strengthening electoral integrity and democracy around the globe.</p>",

Yet it is unclear whether dissatisfaction with the conduct of elections translates into voting preferences at the ballot box, and there are many conditions under which this ideal model fails, even in democratic states. To illuminate, the chapter compares some selected case studies, including Watergate in the United States, the Fujimori scandal and the Peruvian general election in 2000, and the Recruit scandal and Japanese elections in 1993. Finally, it assesses the more general lessons arising from contributions to this book, considers the broader consequences of the transparency-accountability-compliance nexus for understanding processes of electoral integrity and malpractice, and identifies some of the key policy implications that follow from the analysis.</p>",
