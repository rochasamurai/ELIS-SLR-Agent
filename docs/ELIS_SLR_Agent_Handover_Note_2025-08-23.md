# 📄 ELIS SLR Agent — Handover Note (Filled Version on ChatGPT)

**Project:** Electoral Integrity Strategies (ELIS 2025) — Systematic Literature Review (SLR) Agent

## 🎯 Objective
To ensure the **ELIS SLR Agent** can operate reliably with canonical JSON/JSONL data files, schema definitions, and Excel workbooks — aligned to the locked governance policy and ready for execution/testing.

---

## 📑 References
- `data/ELIS_Data_Sheets_2025-08-19_v1.0.xlsx` (master workbook, tabs A–E).  
- `json_jsonl/` (canonical JSON files):  
  - `ELIS_Appendix_A_Search.json`  
  - `ELIS_Appendix_B_Screening.json`  
  - `ELIS_Appendix_B_InclusionExclusion.json`  
  - `ELIS_Appendix_C_DataExtraction.json`  
- `schemas/` (internal validation, not stored beyond canonical use).  
- `docs/ELIS_FilePolicy.md` (governance rules).  
- `CHANGELOG.md` (latest release: [2.0.5] – 2025-08-23).

## 📌 Current Status
- ✅ JSON design locked: one canonical file per Appendix (A–C) with top-level object and `records` array.  
- ✅ Example rows added to each JSON (aligned with Excel tab headers).  
- ✅ Governance confirmed: canonical names only; schemas for validation only; releases archived by date.  
- ⚠️ Pending: validation re-run of updated JSON files against regenerated schemas.  
- ⚠️ Pending: first round-trip test (JSON ⇄ Excel) with the Agent.  

---

## 🚧 Decisions & Blockers
- No new file names or folder structures allowed — canonical only.  
- Long chats becoming heavy and unstable — need to continue work in a **new conversation**.  
- All artefacts and documentation must remain in **UK English**.  

---

## 🔜 Next Actions
1. Validate canonical JSON files (A, B Screening, B Inclusion/Exclusion, C Extraction) against the workbook-derived schemas.  
2. Correct any issues **in place** (no extra files created).  
3. Generate dated validation report in `validation_reports/`.  
4. Run a minimal test with one mock article flowing through Appendices A → B → C.  
5. Log results to `CHANGELOG.md` and Appendix D (AuditLog) when available.

## 📂 Artefacts to Carry Forward
- `data/ELIS_Data_Sheets_2025-08-19_v1.0.xlsx`  
- `json_jsonl/ELIS_Appendix_A_Search.json`  
- `json_jsonl/ELIS_Appendix_B_Screening.json`  
- `json_jsonl/ELIS_Appendix_B_InclusionExclusion.json`  
- `json_jsonl/ELIS_Appendix_C_DataExtraction.json`  
- `CHANGELOG.md` (at v2.0.5)

---

## ⚠️ Risks
- Drift between JSON keys and Excel headers could break the Agent.  
- Excessive version/file proliferation could reduce maintainability (guardrail: **locked governance policy**).  
- Chat length may again slow execution — keep future threads shorter and checkpoint progress regularly.  

---

## 👥 Roles
- **Principal Investigator:** Human researcher.  
- **Senior Researcher GPT:** Assist with validation, logging, and corrections (not replacing human decisions).  
- **ELIS Agent:** Executes workflow once inputs are validated.

## 📥 Ask (to begin the new chat)
**Validate all four canonical JSON files (A–C) against the workbook `ELIS_Data_Sheets_2025-08-19_v1.0.xlsx` and provide a corrected version of any file that fails, saved under its canonical name. Generate a dated validation report in `validation_reports/`.**
