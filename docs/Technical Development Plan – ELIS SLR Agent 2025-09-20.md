# Technical Development Plan – ELIS SLR Agent

*Last updated: 20 September 2025*

## Overview

The **ELIS SLR Agent** is an AI-driven assistant designed to automate key steps of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) under the **ELIS Protocol** framework. This project aims to create a robust, low-touch pipeline for SLR data handling – from search and screening to data extraction – with heavy emphasis on validation and governance. In practice, the agent will ingest literature data, apply inclusion/exclusion criteria, extract structured information, and output results in standardized JSON formats. All of this occurs under strict compliance with the ELIS Protocol (currently **v1.41**[\[1\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/validation_reports/2025-09-16_validation_report.md#L30-L32)), which defines the methodology and data structures for the review. By adhering to a fixed *Data Contract v1.0* (the formal specification of data fields and formats), the ELIS SLR Agent ensures consistency and reproducibility across runs. The overarching goal is to significantly improve SLR efficiency while maintaining high quality and transparency – enabling automated or assisted reviews that are auditable and align with best practices in evidence synthesis[\[2\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Repository_Creation_Package.md#L3-L5).

## Objectives

The ELIS SLR Agent project has several primary technical and functional objectives:

* **Automate SLR Tasks:** Fully or semi-automate literature search, screening, and data extraction phases. The agent should handle tasks such as querying databases, deduplicating results, triaging studies (inclusion/exclusion), and pulling out key data points with minimal human intervention. This automation targets a measurable efficiency gain (e.g. **≥30%** reduction in manual screening hours) while preserving review rigour[\[3\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Pilot_Plan.md#L10-L14).

* **Maintain High Quality:** Achieve accuracy and recall on par with or better than manual reviews. For instance, the agent’s screening stage should attain **≥0.95 recall** (i.e. it finds at least 95% of the relevant studies that a human would include) and the data extraction errors should be **≤2%** at the cell level[\[3\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Pilot_Plan.md#L10-L14). Quality is further ensured by strict schema validation of all outputs – any deviation from the expected format or missing required data is caught by validators before results are used.

* **Robust Validation & Compliance:** Integrate validation at every step so that *all artifacts are schema-compliant and policy-compliant*. Every JSON file generated (search results, screening decisions, extraction tables, logs) must conform exactly to the predefined schema (no extraneous fields, correct data types, required fields present)[\[4\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/README.md#L20-L25). The agent’s operations are aligned with the ELIS Protocol rules, meaning it follows the same inclusion criteria, coding taxonomy, and output structure that a human reviewer would under the protocol.

* **Reproducibility & Governance:** Ensure that every run of the agent is reproducible and version-controlled. The repository acts as the single source of truth for input configurations and outputs – all changes are tracked via Git. Critical reference documents (like the Data Contract and Protocol specs) are *frozen* at known versions to prevent drift during a review[\[5\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Pilot_Plan.md#L80-L85). We log each agent run’s actions in an audit log (JSONL) for transparency. By enforcing runs through GitHub pull requests and CI checks, we guarantee that no unvalidated or ad-hoc changes slip in. In short, anyone following the documented process can reproduce the agent’s results on the same dataset.

* **Integration with ELIS Protocol:** Serve as a reference implementation of the ELIS Protocol’s technical approach. The agent is effectively a concrete tool executing the ELIS SLR methodology, so it doubles as a validation of the protocol itself. Feedback from development (e.g. if certain fields or steps are unclear or inefficient) can loop back to inform future protocol revisions. Conversely, as the protocol updates (e.g. to v1.42+), the agent will incorporate those changes in a controlled manner. A dedicated “Appendix F” configuration allows the agent’s run parameters and governance rules to be adjusted in line with protocol changes[\[6\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/json_jsonl/README.md#L26-L34) without modifying core logic.

By meeting these objectives, the ELIS SLR Agent will demonstrate a faster SLR process (fewer person-hours), with uncompromised rigour and complete auditability, aligning with the project’s broader goal of efficient yet trustworthy literature reviews.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organised to separate **documentation**, **data artefacts**, **schemas**, and **tools**, providing a clear layout for contributors and automated processes. Key top-level files and folders include:

* **Root Documents:**

* README.md – Overview of the project and usage instructions (including how to run validations).

* CHANGELOG.md – A chronologically ordered log of changes, following Keep a Changelog format and semantic versioning[\[7\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/CHANGELOG.md#L2-L6) for transparency. This is updated whenever the Data Contract or other major aspects change.

* **docs/** – Project documentation and specifications (version-controlled *contracts* and plans). This folder contains the **Data Contract v1.0** (defining the fields and format for all data), the **Pilot Plan**, a **Project Management (PM) Glossary**, this Technical Development Plan, and the **Handover Note** template, among other reference materials[\[8\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/README.md#L14-L18). All documentation is maintained in UK English as per policy[\[9\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Repository_Creation_Package.md#L4-L5).

* **json\_jsonl/** – Operational data files (JSON/JSONL) that the agent produces or consumes[\[8\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/README.md#L14-L18). This includes all SLR execution outputs, referred to as **Rows**, as well as logs and configuration snapshots:

* *Appendix A–C Rows:* e.g. ELIS\_Appendix\_A\_Search\_rows.json, ...B\_Screening\_rows.json, ...C\_DataExtraction\_rows.json – these JSON files contain arrays of records representing the results of each SLR phase (Search, Screening, Data Extraction respectively)[\[10\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/json_jsonl/README.md#L7-L15). They are the **canonical outputs** the agent works with at runtime.

* *Config Files:* e.g. ELIS\_Appendix\_A\_Search\_config.json, ...\_B\_Screening\_config.json, etc – JSON files with additional metadata or templates for each phase[\[11\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/json_jsonl/README.md#L20-L25). These are authoring artefacts *not used by the agent at runtime* (they serve as governance/reference for humans). The agent strictly uses the \_rows.json files as input/output, whereas \_config.json may hold preparatory info or rich context used by contributors outside the agent’s automation.

* *Logs:* JSON Lines files capturing runtime logs. For example, ELIS\_Appendix\_D\_AuditLog\_YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl records the audit trail of the agent’s actions (search queries, decisions made, etc.), and ELIS\_Agent\_ValidationErrors\_YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl records any schema or validation errors encountered[\[12\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/json_jsonl/README.md#L27-L35). Each line in these files is a JSON object validated against the corresponding schema (Appendix D for audit logs, and a special schema for validation errors).

* *Misc:* The Codebook and run policy are also stored here – e.g. ELIS\_Appendix\_E\_Codebook\_YYYY-MM-DD.json (list of code definitions for categorical data) and ELIS\_Appendix\_F\_RunLogPolicy\_YYYY-MM-DD.json (configuring run parameters or policy flags)[\[13\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/json_jsonl/README.md#L28-L36). These help govern how the agent interprets certain fields or handles logging/rotation.

* **schemas/** – JSON Schema definitions for all structured artefacts[\[14\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/README.md#L16-L18). For each Appendix (A through F) and each log type, there is a corresponding .schema.json file that defines the allowed structure and data types. For instance, ELIS\_Appendix\_A\_Search.schema.json defines the fields for search results, ELIS\_Appendix\_B\_Screening.schema.json for screening decisions, and so on[\[15\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Repository_Creation_Package.md#L38-L46). There are also schemas for the agent’s internal log entries (e.g. ELIS\_Agent\_LogEntry.schema.json) and validation errors. These schemas are used by our validation script and tests to ensure every JSON/JSONL in json\_jsonl/ is correct. (Notably, the Codebook uses item-by-item validation: each entry must match ELIS\_Appendix\_E\_Codebook.schema.json, though the Codebook file as a whole is an array without a separate “array schema”[\[16\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/json_jsonl/README.md#L32-L35).)

* **scripts/** – Python utility scripts and tools for development/validation[\[14\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/README.md#L16-L18). Chief among these is scripts/validate\_json.py, the custom validator script that checks repository structure and JSON contents against schemas. As the project grows, this folder may also contain the agent’s execution code (agent.py), test utilities, or migration scripts. All scripts are written in Python 3 (with style guidelines enforced by linting/format tools).

* **.github/workflows/** (within a hidden .github folder) – GitHub Actions workflow definitions that automate CI/CD tasks. Several YAML files here define triggers and jobs for continuous integration, validation, formatting, automated runs, etc. (Detailed in the next section.) This ensures that on each commit or pull request, the appropriate checks and actions run. The repository also uses GitHub configuration files like CODEOWNERS (to designate reviewers for certain files) and a pull request template (checklist for contributors)[\[17\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Repository_Creation_Package.md#L51-L58)[\[18\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Repository_Creation_Package.md#L119-L126).

* **validation\_reports/** – A directory where validation reports are saved. The CI workflows drop Markdown or log files here to record the results of schema validation runs. For example, each execution of the *Validate* workflow generates a timestamped Markdown report summarising any findings (or confirming that all checks passed)[\[19\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/validation_reports/2025-09-16_validation_report.md#L7-L15). This provides a historical log of repository health. The folder is kept in version control (with a .gitkeep file to ensure it exists even if empty) but the reports themselves are usually added and updated by automated processes.

All folders and files adhere to the naming conventions and policies defined in the Data Contract. In particular, **“Rows” files** have \_rows.json suffix and contain a top-level JSON array of records (with no extra wrapping object and no unrelated metadata)[\[20\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Repository_Creation_Package.md#L12-L16). Conversely, configuration files carry a \_config.json suffix and may include richer structured content (which the agent does not ingest at runtime)[\[11\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/json_jsonl/README.md#L20-L25). This clear separation helps prevent mixing of runtime data and reference info. Additionally, all content (file names, field names, free-text entries) is written in **UK English**[\[9\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Repository_Creation_Package.md#L4-L5), and date/time stamps use UTC in ISO 8601 format (e.g. 2025-09-20T17:00:00Z)[\[4\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/README.md#L20-L25).

## Workflow Tools (GitHub Actions)

To maintain quality and automate routine tasks, the repository employs several **GitHub Actions workflows** (found in .github/workflows/) that trigger on certain events. These workflows are prefixed with **“ELIS –”** to indicate their association with this project. Below is an overview of each workflow and its role:

* **ELIS – Bot Commit:** This workflow allows the team (or the AI assistant) to commit changes to the repository via a GitHub App as an *automated user*. Triggered manually via a workflow dispatch event (with inputs), it takes a file path and content payload and commits it directly to a special integration branch (elis-bot)[\[21\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/bot-commit.yml#L8-L16)[\[22\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/bot-commit.yml#L39-L47). Under the hood, it mints an installation token for our GitHub App and uses the GitHub API to create or update the specified file on the elis-bot branch with the given commit message[\[23\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/bot-commit.yml#L32-L40)[\[24\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/bot-commit.yml#L82-L90). This is a safe way to let the agent or bot update repository files (like adding new data or modifying scripts) without using personal access tokens. The commits by this workflow are authored by **“ELIS Bot”** with a bot email, and can later be merged into main via pull request. In summary, *ELIS – Bot Commit* is the mechanism for programmatic, auditable updates to the repo’s content.

* **ELIS – Autoformat:** This is a code formatting workflow that ensures the codebase remains clean and consistent. It runs on-demand (triggered via workflow dispatch) and uses **Black**, the Python formatter, to reformat the repository’s Python code according to our style standards[\[25\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/autoformat.yml#L32-L40). The workflow checks out the dedicated elis-bot branch with appropriate permissions (using a GitHub App token, similar to above), runs Black in-place on the repository (black .), and if any files were reformatted, it commits those changes with a standardized commit message (e.g. *"chore(format): apply Black autoformat"*)[\[26\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/autoformat.yml#L40-L48)[\[27\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/autoformat.yml#L50-L57). The updated formatting is pushed back to the elis-bot branch for integration. This way, contributors (including automated ones) don’t need to manually fix minor style issues – they can simply invoke *ELIS – Autoformat* and let the bot standardise the code style across the project. Consistent formatting reduces noise in diffs and helps spotlight real logic changes in reviews.

* **ELIS – CI:** The continuous integration workflow that runs on every pull request (and possibly on pushes to main) to perform automated checks. Its primary purpose is to **prevent integration of any code or data that violate our quality standards**. When code is pushed in a PR, this workflow will typically install dependencies and run a suite of checks:

* **Linting:** Run **Ruff** (our Python linter) to catch any syntax errors, unused imports, or style guide violations in the code. Ruff enforces PEP 8 and other best practices quickly.

* **Formatting Check:** Run **Black** in check mode (non-destructive) to ensure the code is already properly formatted (if not, the contributor should run the autoformatter or fix formatting).

* **Schema Validation:** Execute the validate\_json.py script in strict mode on all JSON/JSONL files[\[28\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Repository_Creation_Package.md#L74-L82). This ensures no data files break the schema rules; any schema violation or structural issue will cause the CI to fail. In strict mode, even minor warnings are treated as errors (ensuring absolute adherence to the Data Contract).

* **Testing:** Run **Pytest** to execute any unit or integration tests written for the agent. As the project grows, we expect to maintain tests for critical functionalities (e.g. a test might load a small dummy JSON through the agent to verify it produces expected output). All tests must pass for the PR to be considered healthy.

The *ELIS – CI* workflow is crucial for quality control: it acts as a gatekeeper that catches problems early in the development process. For example, if a contributor forgets to update a schema after changing a field in a \_rows.json file, CI will flag the validation error; if a code change introduces a bug or style issue, CI will catch that via tests or linting. Only when this workflow passes (green) can changes be merged. This aligns with our goal of **“0 schema violations”** and overall robustness[\[29\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Pilot_Plan.md#L12-L15). \- **ELIS – Validate:** This workflow specifically focuses on running the comprehensive JSON validation across the repository and recording the results. It can be triggered manually or automatically on certain changes (e.g. when docs/ or any JSON/schema file is modified on the main branch)[\[30\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-validate.yml#L18-L26). The job uses scripts/validate\_json.py to scan the repository (without failing on minor issues) and always produces a **Validation Report**. The output is a Markdown report summarising the checks and listing any findings (distinguishing between BLOCKER issues vs. minor warnings)[\[31\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/scripts/validate_json.py#L40-L49)[\[32\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/scripts/validate_json.py#L88-L96). This report is saved under validation\_reports/ and the workflow will open a pull request to add the new report into the repo[\[33\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-validate.yml#L100-L109). The workflow even attempts to auto-merge that PR (using the GitHub API) so that the report lands on main immediately if no human review is required[\[34\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-validate.yml#L140-L149)[\[35\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-validate.yml#L153-L161). In case repository rules demand a review, it will request one and leave the PR open[\[36\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-validate.yml#L140-L148)[\[37\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-validate.yml#L159-L167). The *ELIS – Validate* workflow ensures that there's always an up-to-date audit of the repository's validity. It's essentially a nightly (or on-change) “health check” that keeps a record of compliance with the data schemas and any deviations. Over time, these reports help track improvements or regressions in data quality. (A typical **Validation Report** will note if all critical checks passed, list any missing files or other issues, and align the validation scope with the current protocol version[\[19\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/validation_reports/2025-09-16_validation_report.md#L7-L15)[\[38\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/validation_reports/2025-09-16_validation_report.md#L29-L32).) \- **ELIS – Agent Run:** This workflow operationalises the agent – it actually executes the ELIS SLR Agent logic in a controlled environment. There are two ways it runs: (1) **manually** via a workflow dispatch (e.g. a maintainer can click “Run workflow” to start an agent run), or (2) **automatically** when certain parts of the repository change (like when schemas/ or the agent code is updated, indicating the agent’s behavior might have changed)[\[39\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-agent-run-new.yml#L2-L10). The Agent Run workflow does the following: 1\. **Setup**: It checks out the repository and sets up Python (ensuring it has the same code and definitions as the current repo state)[\[40\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-agent-run-new.yml#L22-L31). 2\. **Dependencies**: Installs required packages (from requirements.txt, which likely include the OpenAI client, request libraries for APIs like Crossref, etc.)[\[41\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-agent-run-new.yml#L41-L48). 3\. **Execute Agent**: Runs python scripts/agent.py with appropriate arguments[\[42\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-agent-run-new.yml#L46-L54). This script contains the core logic of the ELIS SLR Agent – for example, it may read input configs or example prompts, then perform tasks such as calling the Crossref API to fetch references (using CROSSREF\_API\_KEY), querying OpenAI for classification or extraction tasks (using OPENAI\_API\_KEY), and then writing results to the json\_jsonl/ folder. The workflow injects those API keys from secrets so the agent can operate. In the current configuration, the agent’s output is written directly into the json\_jsonl/ files (e.g., updating the Search\_rows, Screening\_rows, etc., as needed)[\[42\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-agent-run-new.yml#L46-L54). 4\. **Create PR with Results**: After the agent script completes, the workflow will git status to see what files changed (the expectation is that some files in json\_jsonl/ have new content)[\[43\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-agent-run-new.yml#L50-L58). It then uses the Create Pull Request action to open a PR from a branch (named bot/elis-agent-update) with those changes[\[44\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-agent-run-new.yml#L56-L64). The PR description notes that it’s an automated update and lists what was updated (e.g. “generated artefacts in json\_jsonl/ following Option A”)[\[45\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-agent-run-new.yml#L62-L70). The PR is labelled (for auto-merge) and even set to automerge if possible[\[46\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-agent-run-new.yml#L74-L82), so that if all checks (particularly the Validate workflow) pass, it can merge without human intervention. Finally, it posts a summary of the run – confirming whether the validate check passed and whether the PR merged successfully[\[47\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-agent-run-new.yml#L94-L102)[\[48\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-agent-run-new.yml#L108-L116).

The *Agent Run* workflow essentially allows the ELIS SLR Agent to be executed in a repeatable way and its outputs to flow back into the repository through a PR. This could be used, for example, to periodically update the screening decisions or refresh search results as new data comes in – all while keeping everything versioned and validated. By chaining it with the Validate workflow (which runs immediately after via PR checks), we ensure that any outputs the agent produces are automatically validated before merging. \- **ELIS – Slash Commands:** This workflow enables on-demand agent runs by using GitHub issue comments as triggers. It listens for comments on issues or PRs that contain a specific command (in our case, /run-elis)[\[49\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-slash.yml#L12-L20). When someone (with proper permissions) comments “/run-elis”, the workflow kicks off. Under the hood, it performs a similar sequence to the Agent Run workflow: checking out the repo, installing dependencies, and running the agent. In this variant, the agent is run perhaps with slightly different parameters – e.g., scripts/agent.py \--input schemas \--examples examples \--out outputs as indicated by the workflow file[\[50\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-slash.yml#L28-L34). This might direct output to a separate outputs/ folder or use example inputs, allowing a dry-run or test run. After running, this workflow also creates a pull request with the results on the bot/elis-agent-update branch[\[51\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-slash.yml#L34-L41), just like the main Agent Run. The PR references the issue comment that triggered it for traceability. Essentially, *ELIS – Slash Commands* provides an easy interface for project collaborators: they can simply write a command in a GitHub issue (e.g. to ask the agent to process new data or validate something), and the automation takes over, updating the repository through a PR. This lowers the barrier to use the agent – no need to manually dispatch workflows via the Actions tab – and keeps a record in the issue thread of what was requested and when.

Together, these workflows form an automation backbone for the ELIS SLR Agent project. They ensure that formatting is consistent, validations are always run, the agent can be executed reproducibly, and all outputs are reviewed. They also enforce a separation of duties: for instance, the *Bot Commit* and *Autoformat* workflows use a bot account and dedicated branch (elis-bot or bot/\*) to make changes, which are then merged via PR – this means all automated changes still undergo the normal PR review/CI process. The use of branches like bot/elis-agent-update for agent outputs and elis-bot for autoformat ensures the main branch remains protected and human-reviewed at all times.

## Validation and Quality Assurance

Ensuring the correctness of both the agent’s code and its data outputs is a top priority. The project employs multiple layers of validation and quality checks:

* **JSON Schema Validation (via validate\_json.py):** We have a custom Python validator script (scripts/validate\_json.py) that performs structural and content checks on the repository’s JSON and JSONL files. This script is run in CI (and can be run locally) to guarantee that all **execution artefacts** (“Rows” files and logs) conform to their schemas[\[28\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Repository_Creation_Package.md#L74-L82). It checks for the presence of required directories and files, verifies that the canonical data file (the Excel “Data Sheets” workbook in /docs) is present, and scans each JSON/JSONL against the correct schema[\[52\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/scripts/validate_json.py#L47-L56)[\[53\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/scripts/validate_json.py#L58-L66). Any schema violations, missing keys, or disallowed additional properties will be reported. The validator classifies findings with severity (e.g. “\[BLOCKER\] Missing required directory” vs “\[MINOR\] Advisory”)[\[31\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/scripts/validate_json.py#L40-L49). In CI, any BLOCKER finding causes a failure (preventing merge) while no-blocker or no findings results in a pass[\[32\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/scripts/validate_json.py#L88-L96). The output of the script is also saved as a validation report (as described earlier), providing an auditable trail of data quality[\[19\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/validation_reports/2025-09-16_validation_report.md#L7-L15). This rigorous validation step means that by the time data is used in analysis or a report, it’s already been vetted for completeness and correctness according to the ELIS Protocol’s data contract.

* **Code Linting (Ruff):** All Python code in the repository is statically analyzed using **Ruff**, a fast Python linter. Ruff checks for coding errors (like syntax issues), enforces style conventions (e.g. PEP 8 compliance), and flags common mistakes or bad practices. It’s configured to catch things like unused imports, undefined variables, overly complex expressions, etc. Running Ruff regularly (and in CI) keeps the codebase clean and maintainable. Because our project involves an AI agent and automation, clear and correct code is essential for reliability and for when multiple contributors (or the GPT assistant) work on the code.

* **Code Formatting (Black):** We use **Black** to automatically format Python code. Black’s uncompromising rules mean that everyone’s contributions are formatted the same way, eliminating stylistic discrepancies. As described, developers can run Black locally or use the *Autoformat* workflow to have it done for them. In CI, we also run Black in “check” mode to ensure no code deviates from the standard (if it does, the CI will fail, prompting the contributor to format the code). Consistent formatting not only makes the code nicer to read but also avoids petty merge conflicts or diffs caused by whitespace/format changes. Our commit history even shows automated commits like *“chore(format): apply Black autoformat”*, indicating formatting adjustments were made[\[54\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/autoformat.yml#L48-L56).

* **Automated Testing (Pytest):** As the project evolves, we are incorporating a test suite using **Pytest** to verify the agent’s behavior. These tests cover both unit tests (for individual functions or components, such as a function that normalizes search query strings) and integration tests (running a small end-to-end scenario through the agent). For example, a test might load a tiny sample of input data (one or two references) and run the agent in a dry-run mode, then assert that the output JSON matches expected values or that certain log entries are produced. We also validate edge cases – ensuring the agent gracefully handles an empty search result, or a missing field, etc., without crashing. All tests are stored in the repository (e.g. in a tests/ directory) and run automatically in CI. By requiring tests to pass before merge, we catch regressions early. In addition, having tests allows us to refactor or extend the code with confidence, knowing that if something breaks, the test suite will alert us.

* **Continuous Integration Workflow:** The *ELIS – CI* GitHub Action ties together the above tools on each PR. On every proposed change, the CI will:

* Set up an isolated environment and install the project’s dependencies (ensuring consistency).

* Run Ruff and Black checks – any lint or format issue will mark the build as failed.

* Run validate\_json.py \--strict – any schema deviation will fail the build (strict mode treats any warning as error, effectively aiming for 0 warnings)[\[28\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Repository_Creation_Package.md#L74-L82).

* Run Pytest – any failing test will fail the build.

Only if all steps succeed will the PR get a “✅ CI” status. This rigorous process ensures that the **main branch is always in a deployable, stable state** where data is valid and code quality is high. It also reinforces the discipline that changes to data schemas or contracts must be reflected by corresponding updates in data files and tests (or else the CI will complain).

* **Manual Reviews and QA:** In addition to automated checks, we have human oversight especially for critical changes. The repository uses a CODEOWNERS file tagging responsible reviewers for certain areas (e.g. schema changes might request a review from a data steward). We also employ the pull request template checklist[\[55\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Repository_Creation_Package.md#L121-L126) to remind contributors to double-check UK English usage, run the validator locally, update the changelog (if schemas or contract changes), etc., before requesting a review. This human-in-the-loop process, combined with the machine checks, creates a culture of quality. Every merged change has passed both automated scrutiny and (in most cases) human review, making the end product reliable.

* **Versioning and Releases:** As noted, we follow semantic versioning for the agent and data specification. Any breaking change to the Data Contract or major new feature for the agent will bump the version accordingly (reflected in CHANGELOG.md and in any version fields in data)[\[7\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/CHANGELOG.md#L2-L6). This way, if someone uses the agent or data, they can cite the version (e.g. “ELIS SLR Agent v2.0.5, Protocol v1.41”) and be confident about compatibility. In practice, we tag releases in Git, and the changelog entries detail what changed. This helps consumers of the data or tool (e.g. a meta-research team evaluating our pilot) to know exactly what they’re looking at.

In summary, our validation and QA approach is multi-faceted – *schema validation* guarantees data integrity, *linting/formatting* guarantees code integrity, *tests* guarantee functional integrity, and *CI enforcement* guarantees nothing slips through the cracks. By combining these, we strive for an outcome where the agent’s outputs are not only scientifically valid but also technically sound and reproducible.

## Development Milestones

The ELIS SLR Agent project is being developed in stages, with each milestone building on the previous to eventually realize a fully operational and reliable SLR agent. Below is a roadmap of the planned feature additions and improvements, roughly in chronological order:

1. **Foundation & Repository Setup (Milestone 1 – Completed):** The first milestone was to establish the core repository structure and baseline validation tools. This included defining the *Data Contract v1.0* and freezing it[\[56\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/CHANGELOG.md#L42-L50), setting up the JSON schemas for all Appendices (A through F), and populating the repository with initial template files. The validate\_json.py script was developed to enforce the contract, and the initial GitHub Actions (validation workflow) was configured to run on pushes/PRs[\[28\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Repository_Creation_Package.md#L74-L82)[\[57\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Repository_Creation_Package.md#L91-L99). By the end of this phase, we had a green initial CI run (confirming that all required files were in place and conforming) – essentially “Gate 1 – Operational” achieved (the repo is operational with CI passing)[\[58\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Pilot_Plan.md#L48-L56)[\[59\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Pilot_Plan.md#L97-L101).

2. **Populate Example Data & Align with Spec (Milestone 2 – Completed):** With the structure in place, the next step was to input actual data examples and ensure everything aligns with the ELIS Protocol specification. We added example records to the Appendix A, B, C JSON files to serve as placeholders and tests[\[60\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/CHANGELOG.md#L18-L25). These records were chosen to match the headers and formats defined in the official Excel data sheets (the canonical reference)[\[61\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/CHANGELOG.md#L24-L31). In doing so, we locked down the JSON format: moving to one canonical \_rows.json per appendix (rather than multiple fragments), each containing a top-level **records array** (or similar structure) as defined by the contract[\[62\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/CHANGELOG.md#L26-L31). We also formalized the separation that config files are for authoring only and not consumed at runtime[\[63\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/CHANGELOG.md#L46-L49)[\[64\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/CHANGELOG.md#L61-L64). By the end of this stage (circa version 2.0.5), the repository contained realistic data structures and passed validation against the composite workbook schema. This milestone effectively prepared the ground for the agent to run, by ensuring it has well-structured input/output files to work with.

3. **Initial End-to-End Agent Test (Milestone 3 – In Progress):** The current focus is to confirm the ELIS SLR Agent logic on a small scale before scaling up. The plan is to run a **minimal end-to-end test with one or two mock articles** through all phases[\[65\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/CHANGELOG.md#L10-L15). This means using the agent to perform a literature search (perhaps against a known database or a stubbed function returning a static result), then simulate screening on that result (possibly via an AI prompt or simple rule), and finally perform data extraction on a full-text (which could be mocked). The outputs of each stage will be captured in the JSON files, and then validated. The goal of this milestone is twofold: (a) to verify that the agent’s code can indeed populate the JSON structures correctly (with no schema errors) and (b) to identify any gaps or misalignments early (for example, if a field that the agent wants to output isn’t in the schema, or if some value format doesn’t match the expected pattern). Achieving a successful run on a toy example will give confidence that the system is wired correctly. After this test, we expect to possibly adjust the agent code or schemas slightly based on what we learn (this corresponds to the “confirm ELIS Agent readiness” task in our planning[\[66\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/CHANGELOG.md#L12-L15)).

4. **Pilot Implementation (Milestone 4 – Upcoming):** Once the agent works on a small scale, the next milestone is to conduct a full **pilot SLR** using the agent in a real scenario. According to our Pilot Plan, this involves selecting a well-defined topic (electoral integrity subtopic) and using the agent to perform:

5. A comprehensive search across databases (resulting in Appendix A Search\_rows filled with \~5,000–8,000 deduplicated records)[\[67\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Pilot_Plan.md#L18-L26).

6. Dual screening of titles/abstracts (with human reviewers R1 and R2 making inclusion/exclusion decisions, possibly aided by the agent suggestions, and the agent consolidating or recording final decisions in Appendix B\_Screening\_rows and \_InclusionExclusion\_rows)[\[68\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Pilot_Plan.md#L50-L58).

7. Extraction of key data from a subset of studies (the agent will populate Appendix C\_DataExtraction\_rows for a small gold set and then for the broader set)[\[69\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Pilot_Plan.md#L52-L60).

During this pilot run, the agent’s automated actions will be interwoven with human oversight (for example, humans will resolve screening conflicts). The milestone deliverable is a complete set of populated Rows JSON files (A, B, C, plus accompanying logs in D, and an updated codebook E and run policy F if needed) which pass all validations. We will also capture performance metrics: efficiency gain (time saved), recall achieved, and extraction accuracy, comparing to baseline manual performance[\[70\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Pilot_Plan.md#L10-L15). Hitting the target KPIs (≥30% efficiency, ≥95% recall, ≤2% errors) will be a measure of success for the pilot[\[71\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Pilot_Plan.md#L66-L74). This milestone corresponds to reaching “Gate 2 – Productive” and partially “Gate 3 – Reliable & Repeatable” in our project plan, demonstrating that the agent can productively contribute to a live SLR effort. 5\. **Refinement & Hardening (Milestone 5 – Upcoming):** After the pilot, we anticipate a phase of refinement. This involves analyzing the pilot outcomes to identify improvements: maybe the agent needs better handling of edge cases where data was inconsistent, or perhaps the schema could be extended to capture an additional variable that was found important. We will address any discovered bugs (e.g. if certain outputs weren’t deterministic or if some schema constraints were too strict/lenient). Another aspect is improving the **robustness** of the system: implementing additional validation in validate\_json.py (for instance, cross-checking that certain fields match controlled vocabularies, or that log entries cover all steps)[\[72\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/validation_reports/2025-09-16_validation_report.md#L24-L28), and enhancing error handling in the agent code (so that one failure doesn’t derail a whole run). We may also expand our test suite to cover scenarios encountered in the pilot that weren’t previously tested.

In this milestone, we’ll also integrate more of the development workflow niceties that were deferred during initial development. For example, we might introduce **pre-commit hooks** to run Black/Ruff before every commit (the groundwork for this exists in docs/Git\_Workflow.md and was planned once the agent stabilizes[\[73\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/CHANGELOG.md#L80-L87)). We may also tighten branch protection settings now that automation flows are proven – e.g. requiring the Validate workflow to pass on main at all times, or requiring an approving review for any non-bot PRs. 6\. **Extended Features & Scaling (Milestone 6 – Future):** Looking further ahead, the plan includes scaling up the agent’s capabilities and possibly applying it to new contexts. Some envisioned enhancements: \- **Full-Text Review Assistance:** Extend the agent to help with full-text screening or critical appraisal (this could be an Appendix G if introduced by the ELIS Protocol in future). For instance, integrating an NLP model to summarize PDFs or flag important passages for inclusion. \- **Meta-Analysis Prep:** While meta-analysis is out of scope for the pilot, a future agent version might compile extraction data into preliminary summary statistics or evidence tables. \- **Multi-language Support:** The current protocol and agent assume English (and specifically UK English for outputs), but a future need might be to handle studies in other languages. This could involve integrating translation APIs or multilingual NLP models. \- **Continuous Updates:** Enabling the agent to run periodically (e.g. monthly) to catch new publications on the research question and update the SLR results. This would move the project toward a “living systematic review” model. The scheduling could be achieved via GitHub Actions (a cron trigger) combined with the existing agent-run workflow. \- **Protocol Version Upgrades:** When the ELIS Protocol itself updates (say to v1.5 or v2.0 in the future), incorporate those changes: e.g. new data fields, refined definitions, new appendices. This will involve planning migrations of existing data and backward compatibility, if needed, so part of this future milestone is designing how to smoothly transition the agent and data to updated standards.

These later milestones are more exploratory and will be detailed in future planning documents. They represent the “roadmap” beyond the initial pilot and stabilization. Achieving them would mark the project as reaching “Gate 3 – Reliable & Repeatable” in full, and even exceeding it by adding new value.

Each milestone above has rough chronological ordering, but in practice some may overlap (for example, basic tests were written during milestone 2 and 3; some refinement tasks might start during the pilot). We prioritise tasks that reduce risk early – for instance, validating our data and doing the small end-to-end test (milestone 3\) is a high priority before diving into the full pilot, as indicated in our plans[\[65\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/CHANGELOG.md#L10-L15). This way, we catch issues when they are cheaper to fix. The development plan is a living guideline and will adjust as we learn from each phase, but it provides clear targets to aim for.

## Contributor Guidelines

We welcome contributions to the ELIS SLR Agent project, but to maintain the project’s high standards, we ask all contributors to follow these guidelines:

* **Code Quality & Style:** All code should adhere to our style guidelines and best practices. We use automated linters and formatters (Ruff and Black) to enforce this, so before you commit, please run ruff . and black . (or use the provided pre-commit hook once enabled) to catch any issues. The codebase should follow PEP 8 conventions and type hints where appropriate. Keep functions and modules focused; prefer clarity over cleverness. Docstrings or comments are encouraged for complex logic, especially since this project involves interactions with external APIs and non-obvious decision logic.

* **Branch Usage:** The repository uses a protected main branch for stable code and data. Contributors should never commit directly to main. Instead, create a feature branch (or use the bot branches if appropriate) and open a Pull Request. Our CI will then run on the PR. There are special branches reserved for automation: elis-bot (for automated formatting or bot commits) and bot/elis-agent-update (for agent output updates via PR) are examples[\[74\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/bot-commit.yml#L2-L10)[\[44\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-agent-run-new.yml#L56-L64). Please avoid using or merging into these branches manually. Generally, name your feature branches descriptively (e.g. feat/new-schema-field or fix/screening-bug) and, if it’s a work-in-progress, mark it as a draft PR.

* **Commit Standards:** We follow a *Conventional Commits* style for commit messages, which also feeds into our changelog. That means commit messages should have a type (feat, fix, chore, docs, etc.) and a short description, e.g. *“feat: add support for multiple queries”*. If a commit is specifically a format/lint fix, you might use *“chore(format): ...”* as done by our bot[\[54\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/autoformat.yml#L48-L56). Please make sure each commit is focused; multiple small, meaningful commits are preferable to one giant commit. When your changes address a GitHub issue, consider referencing it in the commit or PR description (e.g. “closes \#123”). And don’t forget to update CHANGELOG.md for any user-facing changes or any change to the Data Contract or schemas – this is one of the checklist items in our PR template[\[55\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Repository_Creation_Package.md#L121-L126).

* **Testing Changes:** If you’re introducing a new feature or fixing a bug, try to add or update tests in the tests/ directory. Ensure pytest passes all tests before pushing. If your change is data-related (e.g. modifying a schema or JSON content), run python scripts/validate\_json.py \--strict locally to verify that all JSON files still validate[\[28\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Repository_Creation_Package.md#L74-L82). This local validation can save time by catching issues early. Our PR checklist explicitly asks contributors to run the validator locally before submission[\[55\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Repository_Creation_Package.md#L121-L126).

* **Running CI Locally:** While you can rely on GitHub Actions to run CI, it’s often faster to simulate parts of it locally. Aside from the above (ruff, black, pytest, validate script), you can also manually perform what the agent-run workflow does if needed – e.g., run scripts/agent.py with some test inputs to see that it behaves as expected. We encourage using a Python virtual environment that matches the requirements.txt so that you have the same library versions as CI. If you add a new dependency, update requirements.txt accordingly. Note that the CI workflows (especially *ELIS – Validate* and *ELIS – CI*) are configured to be fairly verbose in their logging – if your PR fails CI, inspect the logs for clues. We’ve made sure the validation script prints clear messages about what failed (including JSON path to errors, etc.), and lint/test outputs will pinpoint issues.

* **Communication and Review:** Open communication helps streamline the process. When you open a PR, fill out the description with what and why you are changing. Use the checklist in the PR template to self-verify basics[\[75\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Repository_Creation_Package.md#L121-L129). If your PR is not ready for merge (e.g. you want feedback on an approach), mark it as a draft. Tag relevant people (or the PM) if you need a prompt review due to timelines. Conversely, when reviewing others’ PRs, be constructive and focus on how the change meets the project objectives and maintains quality. We use GitHub’s review feature to approve changes; at least one approval may be required for merge (especially for schema or code changes).

* **Branch Hygiene:** After your PR is merged, delete your feature branch to keep the repository tidy (unless you expect to reuse it for a subsequent related change). Our automation usually deletes its bot branches after merging (e.g. the PRs from *Agent Run* have delete-branch: true set[\[76\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-agent-run-new.yml#L72-L76)). We prefer squash-merging for feature branches to keep a clean commit history, but for bot PRs (like validation reports) we allow direct merge commits for traceability. In any case, the commit history on main should tell a coherent story (and the changelog entries correlate with it).

* **UK English and Consistency:** All contributors must write documentation, code comments, and even commit messages in UK English (this is project policy)[\[9\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/Repository_Creation_Package.md#L4-L5). Use British spelling (e.g. “organise” not “organize”, “artefact” not “artifact”) and maintain a professional, clear tone. Consistency in terminology is also important – use the same names for things as defined in the Data Contract and Glossary (for example, consistently say “Rows” for the JSON execution records, not “entries” or “items”). This avoids confusion and helps future maintainers (or automated assistants) follow along. The PM Glossary in docs/PM\_Glossary\_Acronyms.md is a good reference if you’re unsure about certain terms.

* **Respecting the Data Contract:** If your contribution involves changing the structure of data (like adding a new field to an Appendix schema or changing a controlled vocabulary), recognise that this is a major change. It must be discussed and approved by project leads, and documented in the Data Contract and Changelog. The Data Contract is “spec locked”, meaning changes are infrequent and require a version update. In practical terms, if you propose a schema change, you should also update docs/Data\_Contract\_v1.0.md (or create a v1.1 if we are version-bumping the contract) and note the change under “Unreleased” in the changelog, which can later be moved under a release heading when we tag a new version. The validator script might also need an update if the change affects its expectations. This process ensures that everyone (including external stakeholders using the data) are aware of schema changes.

* **Local Development Environment:** The project currently targets Python 3.11 (as used in CI)[\[77\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/.github/workflows/elis-validate.yml#L56-L64). It’s recommended to use the same version locally to avoid any incompatibilities. Install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt. If you are doing advanced work (like working with the OpenAI API or Crossref API), you will need to set environment variables (OPENAI\_API\_KEY, CROSSREF\_API\_KEY) or have a config for them – be careful not to hardcode secrets or commit them. *Never commit API keys or credentials.* Instead use the project’s secret management (in GitHub Actions or a local .env file ignored by Git). Also, be mindful that running the agent can consume API credits or network calls, so during development, you might want to use smaller test inputs or mock external calls. We aim to eventually include some mocking in tests to avoid hitting real APIs for every test run.

By following these guidelines, contributors ensure that the ELIS SLR Agent remains a high-quality, reliable tool. This not only makes the maintainers happy but also upholds the trust of users who rely on the agent’s outputs for research. Every commit and pull request is a step in building that trust, so we thank contributors for taking the extra effort to do things the right way.

## Appendix

**ELIS Protocol Version:** The development of the ELIS SLR Agent is aligned with **ELIS Protocol v1.41**[\[38\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/validation_reports/2025-09-16_validation_report.md#L29-L32). This means all data structures, terminologies, and processes correspond to the definitions in that version of the protocol. The Data Contract v1.0 in our documentation is effectively a technical translation of the protocol’s requirements (for instance, the protocol’s “Appendix A – Search Results” corresponds to our JSON schema and format for Search\_rows). If the ELIS Protocol updates in the future, the agent will undergo a planned update to remain compatible, including version bumps of the Data Contract and perhaps the agent logic (prompt templates, etc.). We explicitly record the protocol version in our validation logs and will update that reference when we migrate to a newer protocol version.

**Agent Prompt Version:** The ELIS SLR Agent relies on a specific GPT prompt strategy (the “Senior Researcher” persona) to carry out its tasks. This prompt has its own versioning; currently we are using **Agent Prompt v2.0**[\[38\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/validation_reports/2025-09-16_validation_report.md#L29-L32), which has been tailored for the tasks and outputs required by ELIS Protocol v1.41. Any key design decisions or assumptions baked into the agent (for example, how it phrases inclusion criteria or how it interprets codebook entries) are documented in the prompt and supporting docs. The prompt and agent behavior remain fixed during a review cycle to ensure consistency; upgrades to the prompt (v2.1, v3.0, etc.) will be considered only between review projects or pilot phases, not mid-stream.

**Key Design Decisions & Rationale:** Throughout development, we have made several important design choices to balance automation with quality:

* We enforce a strict **separation of configuration vs. execution data**. Configuration files (\*\_config.json) allow human input or rich context (like search query strings, database settings, or template text for extraction), but the agent does *not* read these at runtime[\[4\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/README.md#L20-L25). Instead, the agent focuses on the “Rows” files (\*\_rows.json) which are purely structured data. This was a deliberate decision to keep the runtime surface minimal and machine-friendly, while still preserving human-friendly planning info in the repo. It reduces complexity for the agent (it only deals with one format) and avoids accidental misuse of incomplete config data as real output.

* We chose **JSON and JSONL** as the data formats for all artefacts (over alternatives like CSV or a database) to maximize interoperability and ease of validation. JSON is human-readable, diff-friendly, and works well with Git versioning. The JSON Lines format for logs was selected because it appends nicely (one log entry per line) and each line can be independently schema-validated, which is convenient for continuous logging.

* **UK English mandate:** All outputs (like extracted text) are to be normalised to UK English[\[78\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/CHANGELOG.md#L43-L49). This was less a technical necessity and more a consistency decision given the project context – it ensures that if the agent writes any text (e.g. summarizing a reason for exclusion), it does so in a consistent dialect, which is important for a polished final report. It also aligns with the team’s regional usage. We built this into the guidelines for both humans and AI (the prompt directs the AI to use UK English).

* **Determinism & Repeatability:** We aim (as much as possible) for the agent’s runs to be deterministic – meaning if you run the agent on the same input twice, you get the same output (especially for the critical data fields). This is tricky given the involvement of an AI (which can be non-deterministic) and external APIs. To manage this, we fix random seeds where applicable and plan to log the prompt and steps taken so that a run can be reconstructed. We also treat the first run of the pilot as a calibration, and subsequent runs should ideally not drift. The protocol’s requirement that outputs be reproducible influenced this design. For instance, any random selections (like choosing a subset of studies for gold standard) are either avoided or recorded in the log for traceability.

* **Use of Gates (Quality Gates):** We structured the project phases around **Gate 1, Gate 2, Gate 3** as quality checkpoints (Operational, Productive, Reliable)[\[79\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/docs/ELIS_SLR_Agent_Handover_Note.md#L26-L34). This gating concept is a project management decision to ensure we don’t proceed to broad usage without meeting certain criteria. Technically, this influenced our development plan by prioritising tasks that achieve Gate 1 (basic operational status with CI) before adding complexity, and ensuring pilot success criteria (Gate 2\) are baked into our objectives. It’s a design philosophy: build a little, validate a lot, then build more.

* **Semantic Versioning & Changelog:** We treat the combination of the agent and the data spec as a versioned product. Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) is used to communicate the impact of changes[\[7\]](https://github.com/rochasamurai/ELIS-SLR-Agent/blob/5eef434f917f89b608ba24cb71c0f9d8ede84b74/CHANGELOG.md#L2-L6). For example, introducing a new required field in a schema would be a MAJOR version bump of the Data Contract (since it might break old data or agent logic), whereas adding an optional field or improving the agent’s prompt might be a MINOR update. We maintain a detailed CHANGELOG.md to document every notable change, which is crucial for an audit trail in an academic context. This was a conscious process decision to support transparency and debugging – anyone can read the changelog and understand how the project evolved and why a certain output might differ between versions.

In conclusion, this technical development plan is intended to provide clarity on how the ELIS SLR Agent is being built, how it’s maintained, and where it’s heading, all under the umbrella of the ELIS Protocol. By documenting the architecture, workflows, and guidelines, we aim to ensure that the development process itself is as rigorous and transparent as the systematic reviews the agent is meant to conduct. All decisions are made with the end goal in mind: **a reliable, efficient SLR agent that can be trusted by researchers and practitioners in the loop**.

With this plan, contributors and stakeholders should have a clear understanding of the project’s direction and the standards to uphold, ensuring that as the ELIS SLR Agent grows in capability, it remains aligned with its core purpose and principles.
