# BOT Test â€“ ELIS-SLR-Agent

File created by the **Bot Commit and PR (no-PAT)** workflow using the built-in `GITHEB_TOKEN`.
IT validates that the workflow can:
1) create a new branch,
2) add a new file,
3) push the branch to the remote,
4) and open a Pull Request targeting `main`.

## Verification checklist
- [ ] PR was opened automatically by the workflow.- [] Author shows as **ELIS Bot** (noreply email).
- [ ] File path: `docs/BOT_TEST.mc` exists on the PR branch.- [ ] Workflow run shows all steps successful.

## Next steps
After this PR merges, we will start committing real code files (e.g., `scripts/validate_json.py`) using the same workflow.
