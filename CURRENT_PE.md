Logged AUTO-02 backlog item: gate-1 status lost on branch update, resolved by PE-AUTO-06. | 2026-04-01 |
| PM-CHORE-22  | Closed PE-AUTO-03 as merged (PR #310, PASS verdict — 1 FAIL iteration resolved). Removed `.worktrees/pe-auto-03`. Opened PE-AUTO-04 (Implementer Agent Runner) with `infra-impl-codex` as Implementer and `infra-val-claude` as Validator per alternation rule. | 2026-04-03 |
| PM-CHORE-23  | Closed PE-AUTO-04 as merged (PR #311, PASS verdict). Opened PE-AUTO-05 (Validator Agent Runner) with `infra-impl-claude` as Implementer and `infra-val-codex` as Validator per alternation rule. | 2026-04-03 |
| PM-CHORE-24  | Closed PE-AUTO-05 as merged (PR #312, PASS verdict — CODEX Round 16). Upgraded `elis-codex-bot` and `elis-claude-bot` to write collaborator access so bot reviews satisfy branch protection. Opened PE-AUTO-06 (PE Sequencer — Automatic Advance Between PEs) with `infra-impl-codex` as Implementer and `infra-val-claude` as Validator per alternation rule. | 2026-04-07 |
| PM-CHORE-25  | Closed PE-AUTO-06 as merged (PR #313, PASS verdict). Opened PE-AUTO-07 (PM Agent Arbitration Protocol) with `infra-impl-claude` as Implementer and `infra-val-codex` as Validator per alternation rule. Dependencies PE-AUTO-04 and PE-AUTO-05 satisfied. | 2026-04-08 |
| PM-CHORE-26  | Closed PE-AUTO-07 as merged (PR #314, PASS verdict — 6 FAIL iterations). Opened PE-AUTO-08 (Discord Loop for Autonomous Operation) with `infra-impl-codex` as Implementer and `infra-val-claude` as Validator per alternation rule. Dependencies PE-AUTO-06 and PE-AUTO-07 satisfied. | 2026-04-08 |
| PM-CHORE-27  | Closed PE-AUTO-08 as merged (PR #315, PASS verdict). Opened PE-AUTO-09 (Plan Loader — New Plan Ingestion) with `infra-impl-claude` as Implementer and `infra-val-codex` as Validator per alternation rule. Dependencies PE-AUTO-06 and PE-AUTO-08 satisfied. | 2026-04-09 |
| PM-CHORE-28  | Closed PE-AUTO-09 as merged (PR #316, PASS verdict — 1 FAIL iteration resolved). Opened PE-AUTO-10 (Observability Dashboard) with `infra-impl-codex` as Implementer and `infra-val-claude` as Validator per alternation rule. Dependency PE-AUTO-09 satisfied. | 2026-04-10 |

| PM-CHORE-31  | Extended the automation plan to include PE-AUTO-12 (elis-server Bot Review Identity Activation). Opened PE-AUTO-12 with `infra-impl-codex` as Implementer and `infra-val-claude` as Validator per alternation rule. This PE operationalises backlog item `ELIS-SERVER-01` so live PR review actions on `elis-server` use the correct bot identities instead of the PO account. | 2026-04-11 |
| PM-CHORE-32  | Closed PE-AUTO-12 as merged (PR #321, PASS verdict — 1 FAIL iteration resolved; manual merge by PO after gate-1/review timing gap exposed by PR #321).

| PM-CHORE-33  | Closed PE-AUTO-13 as superseded by Architecture v1.8 (PR #322 closed — scope blocked by `workflow` scope limitation of bot PAT; Gate 2 re-trigger resolved structurally under v1.8 as direct PM action). Adopted `ELIS_MultiAgent_Implementation_Plan_v1_8.md` as governing plan (Hybrid SLR Execution series). Transitioned release to "ELIS Hybrid SLR Execution Plan · v1.8". Opened PE-SLR-01 (Harvest Workflow Contract) with `prog-impl-claude` (Claude Code) as Implementer and `prog-val-codex` (CODEX) as Validator. Architecture v1.8 validated by Claude Code (adversarial independence rule restored, all other invariants confirmed). | 2026-04-12 |
| PM-CHORE-34  | Adopted `ELIS_MultiAgent_Implementation_Plan_v1_8_1.md` as a patch revision to v1.8 while keeping PE-SLR-01 active. Added `PE-INFRA-SLR-01` (Role-Based Agent Surface Normalisation) after PE-SLR-02, shifted downstream default staffing to preserve structural alternation, and formalised provider-neutral workflow surfaces as an explicit release criterion. | 2026-04-13 |
| PM-CHORE-35  | Adopted `ELIS_MultiAgent_Implementation_Plan_v1_8_2.md` as a patch revision to v1.8.1 while keeping PE-SLR-01 active. Added `PE-INFRA-SLR-02` (Distinct Review Identity Enforcement), formalised the requirement that validator-capable agents need distinct GitHub review identities on protected branches, and recorded `elis-gemini-bot` as the required onboarding path for recurring Gemini validator duty. | 2026-04-13 |
| PM-CHORE-36  | Closed PE-SLR-01 as merged (PR #323, PASS verdict). Opened PE-SLR-02 (Harvest Workflow Reliability and Audit) with `gemini-cli` as Implementer and `prog-val-codex` (CODEX @ `elis-server`) as Validator for the next Harvest reliability round. | 2026-04-13 |
| PM-CHORE-37  | Closed PE-SLR-02 as merged (PR #324, r3 PASS verdict — Claude Code as PM-authorised r3 Validator; admin merge after `gate-1` removed from required status checks to resolve structural timing gap).

| PM-CHORE-38  | Adopted `ELIS_MultiAgent_Implementation_Plan_v1_8_3.md` as a patch revision to v1.8.2 while keeping PE-INFRA-SLR-01 active (`implementing`). Added `PE-INFRA-SLR-03` (PM Control-Plane Dispatch Hardening) with six orchestration reliability improvements: cross-agent visibility, direct PM dispatch with ACK contract, reachability/heartbeat gate, command contract, automatic runner fallback, and auditable event trail. Formalised Step 0 runtime evidence requirement for PE-INFRA-SLR-03: proof that PM cross-agent messaging is enabled (`tools.sessions.visibility=all` or equivalent) and one successful PM→validator dispatch/ACK exchange must appear in the opening Status Packet and PR comments before implementation starts.

Alternation rule:
- For consecutive PEs in the same domain, the implementer engine must alternate (`codex` <-> `claude`).
- Validator engine must be opposite to implementer engine.
- Historical rows with status `merged` may predate alternation enforcement and are preserved as audit history.

## PM instructions

1. At the start of every PE: update `PE`, `Branch`, and `Agent roles` table.
2. At the start of every new release: update the entire `Release context` table.
3. Commit and push this file to the base branch before notifying agents to start.
4. If this file is absent or incomplete, agents must stop and notify PM.

## Agent instructions

- Step 0: read `Release context` to know the base branch and plan file for this session.
- Never hardcode specific branch names or plan filenames — always resolve from this file.
- If a field in this file is blank or missing, stop and notify PM.
