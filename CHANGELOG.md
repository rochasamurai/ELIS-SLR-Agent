# Changelog <!--   Format: Keep a Changelog (human-readable), semantic-ish versions, newest first.   All dates in UTC (YYYY-MM-DD). This file is the human source of truth for what changed. -->  ## [v0.1.1-mvp] - 2025-10-02 ### Added - Minimal JSON Schemas for the Data Contract v1.0 (Appendices A, B, C) under `schemas/`. - Hardened validator workflow (ELIS - Validate): always produces a report; opens a report PR only when the report changes. - Bot Commit workflow improvements: accepts raw or Base64 content; normalises line endings; idempotent commits; guarded PR creation.  ### Fixed - CI stability: resolved non-fast-forward and "base64: invalid input" errors in automation paths. - Formatting churn: ensured LF line endings and consistent Black configuration.  ### CI/Automation - ELIS - CI: Black and Ruff green; tests pass or are correctly skipped when not present. - ELIS - Autoformat: normalises line endings and can auto-open a PR to main when configured. - ELIS - Housekeeping: routine clean-up of aged runs and artefacts.  ### Notes - Tagged and published as **Latest** release.  ---  ## [v0.1.0-mvp] - 2025-10-01 ### Added - Initial MVP release for ELIS SLR Agent, toy agent, smoke tests and baseline CI. - Branch protection requiring `quality` and `validate`.  ---  ## [Unreleased] ### Planned - Optional strict RFC 3339 checking for `format: date-time` via `jsonschema[format-nongpl]` and `FormatChecker`. - Expand schemas with additional fields once agreed (governance applies). - Enrich agent logic beyond toy outputs and add more tests.  <!--   Historical notes:   - Keep entries concise.   - Use neutral, UK English phrasing.   - One release = one section; automation-only tweaks may be grouped. -->
