name: ELIS - Validate
# =============================================================================
# Purpose
#   Validate ELIS artefacts (Appendix A/B/C) against MVP schemas and generate
#   a Markdown report. If the report content changed, create/update a PR from
#   'ci/validation-report' into 'main'. Upload the report as a run artifact.
#
# Loop prevention
#   - Triggers only on pushes to 'main' (and manual runs).
#   - Excludes 'validation_reports/**' from triggers, so committing the report
#     never re-triggers this workflow.
#   - Concurrency collapses overlapping runs.
#
# CI triggering on the report PR
#   We mint a short-lived GitHub App installation token and use it to push/open
#   the PR. This ensures your regular CI runs on that PR automatically.
