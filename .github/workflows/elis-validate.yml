# ============================================================
# Workflow: ELIS - Validate
# Purpose:
#   - Run the validator and generate a timestamped Markdown report.
#   - Always ensure a report exists and publish it as an artifact.
#   - Open a PR with the report and merge it via GitHub REST API.
#   - Verify the report actually landed on main (fail if not).
# Notes:
#   - Single trigger (push) to avoid duplicate runs with pull_request.
#   - UK English comments for maintainability/auditability.
