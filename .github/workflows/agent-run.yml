name: ELIS - Agent Run
# ============================================================================
# Purpose
#   Run the ELIS Agent from a chosen ref (branch or tag). The agent reads
#   Appendix A and writes ONLY Appendix B & C. The workflow then:
#     • commits B/C to a write branch (default: ci/agent-autopr)
#     • pushes the branch
#     • opens/reuses a PR into main
#     • uploads B/C as an artifact (downloadable)
#
# Change log (ops-facing)
#   - 2025-10-10: Commit only files that actually exist (B and/or C). This avoids
#                 fatal errors when one of them is not produced in a run.
