# CODEOWNERS — ELIS SLR Agent # Purpose: Require reviews from the right owner(s) on critical paths. # Syntax: https://docs.github.com/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners # Notes: # - Keep owners as GitHub handles or teams (@org/team). Apps/bots cannot be code owners. # - ELIS Bot will open PRs, but reviews remain human-only to ensure governance.  # Global fallback (optional): direct all unmatched paths to the repository owner. *                                   @rochasamurai  # Schemas are the Data Contract — mandatory review. schemas/**                           @rochasamurai  # Validation script(s) — impact CI gates and audit reports. scripts/validate_json.py             @rochasamurai scripts/**                           @rochasamurai  # Workflows — affect CI/CD and bot permissions. .github/workflows/**                 @rochasamurai  # Structured data (Rows, Config, Logs) — changes must be intentional. json_jsonl/**                        @rochasamurai  # Documentation that defines process and governance. docs/**                              @rochasamurai  # Root docs and configuration.
